      DIMINISHING RATIONS--A DEADLY COLD RAIN--HOVERING OVER PITCH PINE FIRES
      --INCREASE ON MORTALITY--A THEORY OF HEALTH.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rations diminished perceptibly day by day. When we first entered we
      each received something over a quart of tolerably good meal, a sweet
      potato, a piece of meat about the size of one's two fingers, and
      occasionally a spoonful of salt. First the salt disappeared. Then the
      sweet potato took unto itself wings and flew away, never to return. An
      attempt was ostensibly made to issue us cow-peas instead, and the first
      issue was only a quart to a detachment of two hundred and seventy men.
      This has two-thirds of a pint to each squad of ninety, and made but a few
      spoonfuls for each of the four messes in the squad. When it came to
      dividing among the men, the beans had to be counted. Nobody received
      enough to pay for cooking, and we were at a loss what to do until somebody
      suggested that we play poker for them. This met general acceptance, and
      after that, as long as beans were drawn, a large portion of the day was
      spent in absorbing games of "bluff" and "draw," at a bean "ante," and no
      "limit."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a number of hours' diligent playing, some lucky or skillful player
      would be in possession of all the beans in a mess, a squad, and sometimes
      a detachment, and have enough for a good meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the meal began to diminish in quantity and deteriorate in quality. It
      became so exceedingly coarse that the common remark was that the next step
      would be to bring us the corn in the shock, and feed it to us like stock.
      Then meat followed suit with the rest. The rations decreased in size, and
      the number of days that we did not get any, kept constantly increasing in
      proportion to the days that we did, until eventually the meat bade us a
      final adieu, and joined the sweet potato in that undiscovered country from
      whose bourne no ration ever returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fuel and building material in the stockade were speedily exhausted.
      The later comers had nothing whatever to build shelter with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after the Spring rains had fairly set in, it seemed that we had not
      tasted misery until then. About the middle of March the windows of heaven
      opened, and it began a rain like that of the time of Noah. It was tropical
      in quantity and persistency, and arctic in temperature. For dreary hours
      that lengthened into weary days and nights, and these again into
      never-ending weeks, the driving, drenching flood poured down upon the
      sodden earth, searching the very marrow of the five thousand hapless men
      against whose chilled frames it beat with pitiless monotony, and soaked
      the sand bank upon which we lay until it was like a sponge filled with
      ice-water. It seems to me now that it must have been two or three weeks
      that the sun was wholly hidden behind the dripping clouds, not shining out
      once in all that time. The intervals when it did not rain were rare and
      short. An hour's respite would be followed by a day of steady, regular
      pelting of the great rain drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find that the report of the Smithsonian Institute gives the average
      annual rainfall in the section around Andersonville, at fifty-six inches
      --nearly five feet--while that of foggy England is only thirty-two. Our
      experience would lead me to think that we got the five feet all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first comers, who had huts, were measurably better off than the later
      arrivals. It was much drier in our leaf-thatched tents, and we were spared
      much of the annoyance that comes from the steady dash of rain against the
      body for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of those who had no tents was truly pitiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat or lay on the hill-side the live-long day and night, and took the
      washing flow with such gloomy composure as they could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      All soldiers will agree with me that there is no campaigning hardship
      comparable to a cold rain. One can brace up against the extremes of heat
      and cold, and mitigate their inclemency in various ways. But there is no
      escaping a long-continued, chilling rain. It seems to penetrate to the
      heart, and leach away the very vital force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only relief attainable was found in huddling over little fires kept
      alive by small groups with their slender stocks of wood. As this wood was
      all pitch-pine, that burned with a very sooty flame, the effect upon the
      appearance of the hoverers was, startling. Face, neck and hands became
      covered with mixture of lampblack and turpentine, forming a coating as
      thick as heavy brown paper, and absolutely irremovable by water alone. The
      hair also became of midnight blackness, and gummed up into elflocks of
      fantastic shape and effect. Any one of us could have gone on the negro
      minstrel stage, without changing a hair, and put to blush the most
      elaborate make-up of the grotesque burnt-cork artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wood was issued to us. The only way of getting it was to stand around
      the gate for hours until a guard off duty could be coaxed or hired to
      accompany a small party to the woods, to bring back a load of such knots
      and limbs as could be picked up. Our chief persuaders to the guards to do
      us this favor were rings, pencils, knives, combs, and such trifles as we
      might have in our pockets, and, more especially, the brass buttons on our
      uniforms. Rebel soldiers, like Indians, negros and other imperfectly
      civilized people, were passionately fond of bright and gaudy things. A
      handful of brass buttons would catch every one of them as swiftly and as
      surely as a piece of red flannel will a gudgeon. Our regular fee for an
      escort for three of us to the woods was six over-coat or dress-coat
      buttons, or ten or twelve jacket buttons. All in the mess contributed to
      this fund, and the fuel obtained was carefully guarded and husbanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manner of conducting the wood business is a fair sample of the
      management, or rather the lack of it, of every other detail of prison
      administration. All the hardships we suffered from lack of fuel and
      shelter could have been prevented without the slightest expense or trouble
      to the Confederacy. Two hundred men allowed to go out on parole, and
      supplied with ages, would have brought in from the adjacent woods, in a
      week's time, enough material to make everybody comfortable tents, and to
      supply all the fuel needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mortality caused by the storm was, of course, very great. The official
      report says the total number in the prison in March was four thousand six
      hundred and three, of whom two hundred and eighty-three died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the first to die was the one whom we expected to live longest. He
      was by much the largest man in prison, and was called, because of this,
      "BIG JOE." He was a Sergeant in the Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and seemed
      the picture of health. One morning the news ran through the prison that
      "Big Joe is dead," and a visit to his squad showed his stiff, lifeless
      form, occupying as much ground as Goliath's, after his encounter with
      David.
    </p>
    <p>
      His early demise was an example of a general law, the workings of which
      few in the army failed to notice. It was always the large and strong who
      first succumbed to hardship. The stalwart, huge-limbed, toil-inured men
      sank down earliest on the march, yielded soonest to malarial influences,
      and fell first under the combined effects of home-sickness, exposure and
      the privations of army life. The slender, withy boys, as supple and weak
      as cats, had apparently the nine lives of those animals. There were few
      exceptions to this rule in the army--there were none in Andersonville. I
      can recall few or no instances where a large, strong, "hearty" man lived
      through a few months of imprisonment. The survivors were invariably
      youths, at the verge of manhood,--slender, quick, active, medium-statured
      fellows, of a cheerful temperament, in whom one would have expected
      comparatively little powers of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory which I constructed for my own private use in accounting for
      this phenomenon I offer with proper diffidence to others who may be in
      search of a hypothesis to explain facts that they have observed. It is
      this:
    </p>
    <p>
      a. The circulation of the blood maintains health, and consequently life by
      carrying away from the various parts of the body the particles of worn-out
      and poisonous tissue, and replacing them with fresh, structure-building
      material.
    </p>
    <p>
      b. The man is healthiest in whom this process goes on most freely and
      continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      c. Men of considerable muscular power are disposed to be sluggish; the
      exertion of great strength does not favor circulation. It rather retards
      it, and disturbs its equilibrium by congesting the blood in quantities in
      the sets of muscles called into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      d. In light, active men, on the other hand, the circulation goes on
      perfectly and evenly, because all the parts are put in motion, and kept so
      in such a manner as to promote the movement of the blood to every
      extremity. They do not strain one set of muscles by long continued effort,
      as a strong man does, but call one into play after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no compulsion on the reader to accept this speculation at any
      valuation whatever. There is not even any charge for it. I will lay down
      this simple axiom:
    </p>
    <p>
      No strong man, is a healthy man
    </p>
    <p>
      from the athlete in the circus who lifts pieces of artillery and catches
      cannon balls, to the exhibition swell in a country gymnasium. If my theory
      is not a sufficient explanation of this, there is nothing to prevent the
      reader from building up one to suit him better. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALABAMIANS AND GEORGIANS--DEATH OF "POLL PARROTT" --A
      GOOD JOKE UPON THE GUARD--A BRUTAL RASCAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two regiments guarding us--the Twenty-Sixth Alabama and the
      Fifty-Fifth Georgia. Never were two regiments of the same army more
      different. The Alabamians were the superiors of the Georgians in every way
      that one set of men could be superior to another. They were manly,
      soldierly, and honorable, where the Georgians were treacherous and brutal.
      We had nothing to complain of at the hands of the Alabamians; we suffered
      from the Georgians everything that mean-spirited cruelty could devise. The
      Georgians were always on the look-out for something that they could
      torture into such apparent violation of orders, as would justify them in
      shooting men down; the Alabamians never fired until they were satisfied
      that a deliberate offense was intended. I can recall of my own seeing at
      least a dozen instances where men of the Fifty-Fifth Georgia Killed
      prisoners under the pretense that they were across the Dead Line, when the
      victims were a yard or more from the Dead Line, and had not the remotest
      idea of going any nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only man I ever knew to be killed by one of the Twenty-Sixth Alabama
      was named Hubbard, from Chicago, Ills., and a member of the Thirty-Eighth
      Illinois. He had lost one leg, and went hobbling about the camp on
      crutches, chattering continually in a loud, discordant voice, saying all
      manner of hateful and annoying things, wherever he saw an opportunity.
      This and his beak-like nose gained for him the name of "Poll Parrot." His
      misfortune caused him to be tolerated where another man would have been
      suppressed. By-and-by he gave still greater cause for offense by his
      obsequious attempts to curry favor with Captain Wirz, who took him outside
      several times for purposes that were not well explained. Finally, some
      hours after one of Poll Parrot's visits outside, a Rebel officer came in
      with a guard, and, proceeding with suspicious directness to a tent which
      was the mouth of a large tunnel that a hundred men or more had been
      quietly pushing forward, broke the tunnel in, and took the occupants of
      the tent outside for punishment. The question that demanded immediate
      solution then was:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the traitor who has informed the Rebels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion pointed very strongly to "Poll Parrot." By the next morning the
      evidence collected seemed to amount to a certainty, and a crowd caught the
      Parrot with the intention of lynching him. He succeeded in breaking away
      from them and ran under the Dead Line, near where I was sitting in, my
      tent. At first it looked as if he had done this to secure the protection
      of the guard. The latter--a Twenty-Sixth Alabamian --ordered him out. Poll
      Parrot rose up on his one leg, put his back against the Dead Line, faced
      the guard, and said in his harsh, cackling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I won't go out. If I've lost the confidence of my comrades I want to
      die."
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the crowd were taken back by this move, and felt disposed to
      accept it as a demonstration of the Parrot's innocence. The rest thought
      it was a piece of bravado, because of his belief that the Rebels would not
      injure, him after he had served them. They renewed their yells, the guard
      again ordered the Parrot out, but the latter, tearing open his blouse,
      cackled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't go; fire at me, guard. There's my heart shoot me right
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. The Rebel leveled his gun and fired. The charge
      struck the Parrot's lower jaw, and carried it completely away, leaving his
      tongue and the roof of his mouth exposed. As he was carried back to die,
      he wagged his tongue rigorously, in attempting to speak, but it was of no
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard set his gun down and buried his face in his hands. It was the
      only time that I saw a sentinel show anything but exultation at killing a
      Yankee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ludicrous contrast to this took place a few nights later. The rains had
      ceased, the weather had become warmer, and our spirits rising with this
      increase in the comfort of our surroundings, a number of us were sitting
      around "Nosey"--a boy with a superb tenor voice--who was singing patriotic
      songs. We were coming in strong on the chorus, in a way that spoke vastly
      more for our enthusiasm for the Union than our musical knowledge. "Nosey"
      sang the "Star Spangled Banner," "The Battle Cry of Freedom," "Brave Boys
      are They," etc., capitally, and we threw our whole lungs into the chorus.
      It was quite dark, and while our noise was going on the guards changed,
      new men coming on duty. Suddenly, bang! went the gun of the guard in the
      box about fifty feet away from us. We knew it was a Fifty-Fifth Georgian,
      and supposed that, irritated at our singing, he was trying to kill some of
      us for spite. At the sound of the gun we jumped up and scattered. As no
      one gave the usual agonized yell of a prisoner when shot, we supposed the
      ball had not taken effect. We could hear the sentinel ramming down another
      cartridge, hear him "return rammer," and cock his rifle. Again the gun
      cracked, and again there was no sound of anybody being hit. Again we could
      hear the sentry churning down another cartridge. The drums began beating
      the long roll in the camps, and officers could be heard turning the men
      out. The thing was becoming exciting, and one of us sang out to the guard:
    </p>
    <p>
      "S-a-y! What the are you shooting at, any how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a shootin' at that ---- ---- Yank thar by the Dead Line, and by ---
      if you'uns don't take him in I'll blow the whole head offn him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Yank? Where's any Yank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, thar--right thar--a-standin' agin the Ded Line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you Rebel fool, that's a chunk of wood. You can't get any furlough
      for shooting that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this there was a general roar from the rest of the camp, which the
      other guards took up, and as the Reserves came double-quicking up, and
      learned the occasion of the alarm, they gave the rascal who had been so
      anxious to kill somebody a torrent of abuse for having disturbed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of our crowd had been out after wood during the day, and secured a
      piece of a log as large as two of them could carry, and bringing it in,
      stood it up near the Dead Line. When the guard mounted to his post he was
      sure he saw a temerarious Yankee in front of him, and hastened to slay
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unusual good fortune that nobody was struck. It was very rare
      that the guards fired into the prison without hitting at least one person.
      The Georgia Reserves, who formed our guards later in the season, were
      armed with an old gun called a Queen Anne musket, altered to percussion.
      It carried a bullet as big as a large marble, and three or four buckshot.
      When fired into a group of men it was sure to bring several down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing one day in the line at the gate, waiting for a chance to go
      out after wood. A Fifty-Fifth Georgian was the gate guard, and he drew a
      line in the sand with his bayonet which we should not cross. The crowd
      behind pushed one man till he put his foot a few inches over the line, to
      save himself from falling; the guard sank a bayonet through the foot as
      quick as a flash. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      A NEW LOT OF PRISONERS--THE BATTLE OF OOLUSTEE--MEN SACRIFICED TO A
      GENERAL'S INCOMPETENCY--A HOODLUM REINFORCEMENT--A QUEER CROWD
      --MISTREATMENT OF AN OFFICER OF A COLORED REGIMENT--KILLING THE SERGEANT
      OF A NEGRO SQUAD.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far only old prisoners--those taken at Gettysburg, Chicamauga and Mine
      Run--had been brought in. The armies had been very quiet during the
      Winter, preparing for the death grapple in the Spring. There had been
      nothing done, save a few cavalry raids, such as our own, and Averill's
      attempt to gain and break up the Rebel salt works at Wytheville, and
      Saltville. Consequently none but a few cavalry prisoners were added to the
      number already in the hands of the Rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first lot of new ones came in about the middle of March. There were
      about seven hundred of them, who had been captured at the battle of
      Oolustee, Fla., on the 20th of February. About five hundred of them were
      white, and belonged to the Seventh Connecticut, the Seventh New Hampshire,
      Forty Seventh, Forty-Eighth and One Hundred and Fifteenth New York, and
      Sherman's regular battery. The rest were colored, and belonged to the
      Eighth United States, and Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts. The story they told
      of the battle was one which had many shameful reiterations during the war.
      It was the story told whenever Banks, Sturgis, Butler, or one of a host of
      similar smaller failures were trusted with commands. It was a senseless
      waste of the lives of private soldiers, and the property of the United
      States by pretentious blunderers, who, in some inscrutable manner, had
      attained to responsible commands. In this instance, a bungling Brigadier
      named Seymore had marched his forces across the State of Florida, to do he
      hardly knew what, and in the neighborhood of an enemy of whose numbers,
      disposition, location, and intentions he was profoundly ignorant. The
      Rebels, under General Finnegan, waited till he had strung his command
      along through swamps and cane brakes, scores of miles from his supports,
      and then fell unexpectedly upon his advance. The regiment was overpowered,
      and another regiment that hurried up to its support, suffered the same
      fate. The balance of the regiments were sent in in the same manner--each
      arriving on the field just after its predecessor had been thoroughly
      whipped by the concentrated force of the Rebels. The men fought gallantly,
      but the stupidity of a Commanding General is a thing that the gods
      themselves strive against in vain. We suffered a humiliating defeat, with
      a loss of two thousand men and a fine rifled battery, which was brought to
      Andersonville and placed in position to command the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the Seventh New Hampshire were an unwelcome addition to
      our numbers. They were N'Yaarkers--old time colleagues of those already in
      with us--veteran bounty jumpers, that had been drawn to New Hampshire by
      the size of the bounty offered there, and had been assigned to fill up the
      wasted ranks of the veteran Seventh regiment. They had tried to desert as
      soon as they received their bounty, but the Government clung to them
      literally with hooks of steel, sending many of them to the regiment in
      irons. Thus foiled, they deserted to the Rebels during the retreat from
      the battlefield. They were quite an accession to the force of our
      N'Yaarkers, and helped much to establish the hoodlum reign which was
      shortly inaugurated over the whole prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forty-Eighth New Yorkers who came in were a set of chaps so odd in
      every way as to be a source of never-failing interest. The name of their
      regiment was 'L'Enfants Perdu' (the Lost Children), which we anglicized
      into "The Lost Ducks." It was believed that every nation in Europe was
      represented in their ranks, and it used to be said jocularly, that no two
      of them spoke the same language. As near as I could find out they were all
      or nearly all South Europeans, Italians, Spaniards; Portuguese,
      Levantines, with a predominance of the French element. They wore a little
      cap with an upturned brim, and a strap resting on the chin, a coat with
      funny little tales about two inches long, and a brass chain across the
      breast; and for pantaloons they had a sort of a petticoat reaching to the
      knees, and sewed together down the middle. They were just as singular
      otherwise as in their looks, speech and uniform. On one occasion the whole
      mob of us went over in a mass to their squad to see them cook and eat a
      large water snake, which two of them had succeeded in capturing in the
      swamps, and carried off to their mess, jabbering in high glee over their
      treasure trove. Any of us were ready to eat a piece of dog, cat, horse or
      mule, if we could get it, but, it was generally agreed, as Dawson, of my
      company expressed it, that "Nobody but one of them darned queer Lost Ducks
      would eat a varmint like a water snake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Albert Bogle, of the Eighth United States, (colored) had fallen into
      the hands of the rebels by reason of a severe wound in the leg, which left
      him helpless upon the field at Oolustee. The Rebels treated him with
      studied indignity. They utterly refused to recognize him as an officer, or
      even as a man. Instead of being sent to Macon or Columbia, where the other
      officers were, he was sent to Andersonville, the same as an enlisted man.
      No care was given his wound, no surgeon would examine it or dress it. He
      was thrown into a stock car, without a bed or blanket, and hauled over the
      rough, jolting road to Andersonville. Once a Rebel officer rode up and
      fired several shots at him, as he lay helpless on the car floor.
      Fortunately the Rebel's marksmanship was as bad as his intentions, and
      none of the shots took effect. He was placed in a squad near me, and
      compelled to get up and hobble into line when the rest were mustered for
      roll-call. No opportunity to insult, "the nigger officer," was neglected,
      and the N'Yaarkers vied with the Rebels in heaping abuse upon him. He was
      a fine, intelligent young man, and bore it all with dignified
      self-possession, until after a lapse of some weeks the Rebels changed
      their policy and took him from the prison to send to where the other
      officers were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro soldiers were also treated as badly as possible. The wounded
      were turned into the Stockade without having their hurts attended to. One
      stalwart, soldierly Sergeant had received a bullet which had forced its
      way under the scalp for some distance, and partially imbedded itself in
      the skull, where it still remained. He suffered intense agony, and would
      pass the whole night walking up and down the street in front of our tent,
      moaning distressingly. The bullet could be felt plainly with the fingers,
      and we were sure that it would not be a minute's work, with a sharp knife,
      to remove it and give the man relief. But we could not prevail upon the
      Rebel Surgeons even to see the man. Finally inflammation set in and he
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negros were made into a squad by themselves, and taken out every day
      to work around the prison. A white Sergeant was placed over them, who was
      the object of the contumely of the guards and other Rebels. One day as he
      was standing near the gate, waiting his orders to come out, the gate
      guard, without any provocation whatever, dropped his gun until the muzzle
      rested against the Sergeant's stomach, and fired, killing him instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeantcy was then offered to me, but as I had no accident policy, I
      was constrained to decline the honor. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      APRIL--LONGING TO GET OUT--THE DEATH RATE--THE PLAGUE OF LICE --THE
      SO-CALLED HOSPITAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      April brought sunny skies and balmy weather. Existence became much more
      tolerable. With freedom it would have been enjoyable, even had we been no
      better fed, clothed and sheltered. But imprisonment had never seemed so
      hard to bear--even in the first few weeks--as now. It was easier to submit
      to confinement to a limited area, when cold and rain were aiding hunger to
      benumb the faculties and chill the energies than it was now, when Nature
      was rousing her slumbering forces to activity, and earth, and air and sky
      were filled with stimulus to man to imitate her example. The yearning to
      be up and doing something-to turn these golden hours to good account for
      self and country--pressed into heart and brain as the vivifying sap
      pressed into tree-duct and plant cell, awaking all vegetation to energetic
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be compelled, at such a time, to lie around in vacuous idleness --to
      spend days that should be crowded full of action in a monotonous,
      objectless routine of hunting lice, gathering at roll-call, and drawing
      and cooking our scanty rations, was torturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to many of our number the aspirations for freedom were not, as with
      us, the desire for a wider, manlier field of action, so much as an intense
      longing to get where care and comforts would arrest their swift progress
      to the shadowy hereafter. The cruel rains had sapped away their stamina,
      and they could not recover it with the meager and innutritious diet of
      coarse meal, and an occasional scrap of salt meat. Quick consumption,
      bronchitis, pneumonia, low fever and diarrhea seized upon these ready
      victims for their ravages, and bore them off at the rate of nearly a score
      a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now became a part of, the day's regular routine to take a walk past the
      gates in the morning, inspect and count the dead, and see if any friends
      were among them. Clothes having by this time become a very important
      consideration with the prisoners, it was the custom of the mess in which a
      man died to remove from his person all garments that were of any account,
      and so many bodies were carried out nearly naked. The hands were crossed
      upon the breast, the big toes tied together with a bit of string, and a
      slip of paper containing the man's name, rank, company and regiment was
      pinned on the breast of his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the dead was indescribably ghastly. The unclosed eyes
      shone with a stony glitter--
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          An orphan's curse would drag to hell
        </p>
        <p>
          A spirit from on high:
        </p>
        <p>
          But, O, more terrible than that,
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the curse in a dead man's eye.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The lips and nostrils were distorted with pain and hunger, the sallow,
      dirt-grimed skin drawn tensely over the facial bones, and the whole framed
      with the long, lank, matted hair and beard. Millions of lice swarmed over
      the wasted limbs and ridged ribs. These verminous pests had become so
      numerous--owing to our lack of changes of clothing, and of facilities for
      boiling what we had--that the most a healthy man could do was to keep the
      number feeding upon his person down to a reasonable limit--say a few
      tablespoonfuls. When a man became so sick as to be unable to help himself,
      the parasites speedily increased into millions, or, to speak more
      comprehensively, into pints and quarts. It did not even seem exaggeration
      when some one declared that he had seen a dead man with more than a gallon
      of lice on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that the irritation from the biting of these myriads
      materially the days of those who died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a sick man had friends or comrades, of course part of their duty, in
      taking care of him, was to "louse" his clothing. One of the most effectual
      ways of doing this was to turn the garments wrong side out and hold the
      seams as close to the fire as possible, without burning the cloth. In a
      short time the lice would swell up and burst open, like pop-corn. This
      method was a favorite one for another reason than its efficacy: it gave
      one a keener sense of revenge upon his rascally little tormentors than he
      could get in any other way. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp165"

      As the weather grew warmer and the number in the prison increased, the
      lice became more unendurable. They even filled the hot sand under our
      feet, and voracious troops would climb up on one like streams of ants
      swarming up a tree. We began to have a full comprehension of the third
      plague with which the Lord visited the Egyptians:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and
          smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice through all the
          land of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
          smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast;
          all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The total number of deaths in April, according to the official report, was
      five hundred and seventy-six, or an average of over nineteen a day. There
      was an average of five thousand prisoner's in the pen during all but the
      last few days of the month, when the number was increased by the arrival
      of the captured garrison of Plymouth. This would make the loss over eleven
      per cent., and so worse than decimation. At that rate we should all have
      died in about eight months. We could have gone through a sharp campaign
      lasting those thirty days and not lost so great a proportion of our
      forces. The British had about as many men as were in the Stockade at the
      battle of New Orleans, yet their loss in killed fell much short of the
      deaths in the pen in April.
    </p>
    <p>
      A makeshift of a hospital was established in the northeastern corner of
      the Stockade. A portion of the ground was divided from the rest of the
      prison by a railing, a few tent flies were stretched, and in these the
      long leaves of the pine were made into apologies for beds of about the
      goodness of the straw on which a Northern farmer beds his stock. The sick
      taken there were no better off than if they had staid with their comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they needed to bring about their recovery was clean clothing,
      nutritious food, shelter and freedom from the tortures of the lice. They
      obtained none of these. Save a few decoctions of roots, there were no
      medicines; the sick were fed the same coarse corn meal that brought about
      the malignant dysentery from which they all suffered; they wore and slept
      in the same vermin-infested clothes, and there could be but one result:
      the official records show that seventy-six per cent. of those taken to the
      hospitals died there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The establishment of the hospital was specially unfortunate for my little
      squad. The ground required for it compelled a general reduction of the
      space we all occupied. We had to tear down our huts and move. By this time
      the materials had become so dry that we could not rebuild with them, as
      the pine tufts fell to pieces. This reduced the tent and bedding material
      of our party--now numbering five--to a cavalry overcoat and a blanket. We
      scooped a hole a foot deep in the sand and stuck our tent-poles around it.
      By day we spread our blanket over the poles for a tent. At night we lay
      down upon the overcoat and covered ourselves with the blanket. It required
      considerable stretching to make it go over five; the two out side fellows
      used to get very chilly, and squeeze the three inside ones until they felt
      no thicker than a wafer. But it had to do, and we took turns sleeping on
      the outside. In the course of a few weeks three of my chums died and left
      myself and B. B. Andrews (now Dr. Andrews, of Astoria, Ill.) sole heirs to
      and occupants of, the overcoat and blanket. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      THE "PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS"--SAD TRANSITION FROM COMFORTABLE BARRACKS TO
      ANDERSONVILLE--A CRAZED PENNSYLVANIAN--DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUTLER BUSINESS.
    </p>
    <p>
      We awoke one morning, in the last part of April, to find about two
      thousand freshly arrived prisoners lying asleep in the main streets
      running from the gates. They were attired in stylish new uniforms, with
      fancy hats and shoes; the Sergeants and Corporals wore patent leather or
      silk chevrons, and each man had a large, well-filled knapsack, of the kind
      new recruits usually carried on coming first to the front, and which the
      older soldiers spoke of humorously as "bureaus." They were the snuggest,
      nattiest lot of soldiers we had ever seen, outside of the "paper collar"
      fellows forming the headquarter guard of some General in a large City. As
      one of my companions surveyed them, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hulloa! I'm blanked if the Johnnies haven't caught a regiment of
      Brigadier Generals, somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by the "fresh fish," as all new arrivals were termed, began to wake
      up, and then we learned that they belonged to a brigade consisting of the
      Eighty-Fifth New York, One Hundred and First and One Hundred and Third
      Pennsylvania, Sixteenth Connecticut, Twenty-Fourth New York Battery, two
      companies of Massachusetts heavy artillery, and a company of the Twelfth
      New York Cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been garrisoning Plymouth, N. C., an important seaport on the
      Roanoke River. Three small gunboats assisted them in their duty. The
      Rebels constructed a powerful iron clad called the "Albemarle," at a point
      further up the Roanoke, and on the afternoon of the 17th, with her and
      three brigades of infantry, made an attack upon the post. The "Albemarle"
      ran past the forts unharmed, sank one of the gunboats, and drove the
      others away. She then turned her attention to the garrison, which she took
      in the rear, while the infantry attacked in front. Our men held out until
      the 20th, when they capitulated. They were allowed to retain their
      personal effects, of all kinds, and, as is the case with all men in
      garrison, these were considerable. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp169"
      id="linkp169"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The One Hundred and First and One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania and
      Eighty-Fifth New York had just "veteranized," and received their first
      instalment of veteran bounty. Had they not been attacked they would have
      sailed for home in a day or two, on their veteran furlough, and this
      accounted for their fine raiment. They were made up of boys from good New
      York and Pennsylvania families, and were, as a rule, intelligent and
      fairly educated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their horror at the appearance of their place of incarceration was beyond
      expression. At one moment they could not comprehend that we dirty and
      haggard tatterdemalions had once been clean, self-respecting, well-fed
      soldiers like themselves; at the next they would affirm that they knew
      they could not stand it a month, in here we had then endured it from four
      to nine months. They took it, in every way, the hardest of any prisoners
      that came in, except some of the 'Hundred-Days' men, who were brought in
      in August, from the Valley of Virginia. They had served nearly all their
      time in various garrisons along the seacoast--from Fortress Monroe to
      Beaufort--where they had had comparatively little of the actual hardships
      of soldiering in the field. They had nearly always had comfortable
      quarters, an abundance of food, few hard marches or other severe service.
      Consequently they were not so well hardened for Andersonville as the
      majority who came in. In other respects they were better prepared, as they
      had an abundance of clothing, blankets and cooking utensils, and each man
      had some of his veteran bounty still in possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was painful to see how rapidly many of them sank under the miseries of
      the situation. They gave up the moment the gates were closed upon them,
      and began pining away. We older prisoners buoyed ourselves up continually
      with hopes of escape or exchange. We dug tunnels with the persistence of
      beavers, and we watched every possible opportunity to get outside the
      accursed walls of the pen. But we could not enlist the interest of these
      discouraged ones in any of our schemes, or talk. They resigned themselves
      to Death, and waited despondingly till he came. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged One Hundred and First Pennsylvanian, who had taken up his
      quarters near me, was an object of peculiar interest. Reasonably
      intelligent and fairly read, I presume that he was a respectable mechanic
      before entering the Army. He was evidently a very domestic man, whose
      whole happiness centered in his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first came in he was thoroughly dazed by the greatness of his
      misfortune. He would sit for hours with his face in his hands and his
      elbows on his knees, gazing out upon the mass of men and huts, with
      vacant, lack-luster eyes. We could not interest him in anything. We tried
      to show him how to fix his blanket up to give him some shelter, but he
      went at the work in a disheartened way, and finally smiled feebly and
      stopped. He had some letters from his family and a melaineotype of a
      plain-faced woman--his wife--and her children, and spent much time in
      looking at them. At first he ate his rations when he drew them, but
      finally began to reject, them. In a few days he was delirious with hunger
      and homesick ness. He would sit on the sand for hours imagining that he
      was at his family table, dispensing his frugal hospitalities to his wife
      and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a motion, as if presenting a dish, he would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Janie, have another biscuit, do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Or,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eddie, son, won't you have another piece of this nice steak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Or,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maggie, have some more potatos," and so on, through a whole family of
      six, or more. It was a relief to us when he died in about a month after he
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated above, the Plymouth men brought in a large amount of money
      --variously estimated at from ten thousand to one hundred thousand
      dollars. The presence of this quantity of circulating medium immediately
      started a lively commerce. All sorts of devices were resorted to by the
      other prisoners to get a little of this wealth. Rude chuck-a-luck boards
      were constructed out of such material as was attainable, and put in
      operation. Dice and cards were brought out by those skilled in such
      matters. As those of us already in the Stockade occupied all the ground,
      there was no disposition on the part of many to surrender a portion of
      their space without exacting a pecuniary compensation. Messes having
      ground in a good location would frequently demand and get ten dollars for
      permission for two or three to quarter with them. Then there was a great
      demand for poles to stretch blankets over to make tents; the Rebels, with
      their usual stupid cruelty, would not supply these, nor allow the
      prisoners to go out and get them themselves. Many of the older prisoners
      had poles to spare which they were saying up for fuel. They sold these to
      the Plymouth folks at the rate of ten dollars for three--enough to put up
      a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most considerable trading was done through the gates. The Rebel guards
      were found quite as keen to barter as they had been in Richmond. Though
      the laws against their dealing in the money of the enemy were still as
      stringent as ever, their thirst for greenbacks was not abated one whit,
      and they were ready to sell anything they had for the coveted currency.
      The rate of exchange was seven or eight dollars in Confederate money for
      one dollar in greenbacks. Wood, tobacco, meat, flour, beans, molasses,
      onions and a villainous kind of whisky made from sorghum, were the staple
      articles of trade. A whole race of little traffickers in these articles
      sprang up, and finally Selden, the Rebel Quartermaster, established a
      sutler shop in the center of the North Side, which he put in charge of Ira
      Beverly, of the One Hundredth Ohio, and Charlie Huckleby, of the Eighth
      Tennessee. It was a fine illustration of the development of the commercial
      instinct in some men. No more unlikely place for making money could be
      imagined, yet starting in without a cent, they contrived to turn and twist
      and trade, until they had transferred to their pockets a portion of the
      funds which were in some one else's. The Rebels, of course, got nine out
      of every ten dollars there was in the prison, but these middle men
      contrived to have a little of it stick to their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the very few who were able to do this. Nine hundred and
      ninety-nine out of every thousand were, like myself, either wholly
      destitute of money and unable to get it from anybody else, or they paid
      out what money they had to the middlemen, in exorbitant prices for
      articles of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The N'Yaarkers had still another method for getting food, money, blankets
      and clothing. They formed little bands called "Raiders," under the
      leadership of a chief villain. One of these bands would select as their
      victim a man who had good blankets, clothes, a watch, or greenbacks.
      Frequently he would be one of the little traders, with a sack of beans, a
      piece of meat, or something of that kind. Pouncing upon him at night they
      would snatch away his possessions, knock down his friends who came to his
      assistance, and scurry away into the darkness. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      LONGINGS FOR GOD'S COUNTRY--CONSIDERATIONS OF THE METHODS OF GETTING
      THERE--EXCHANGE AND ESCAPE--DIGGING TUNNELS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES
      CONNECTED THEREWITH--PUNISHMENT OF A TRAITOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      To our minds the world now contained but two grand divisions, as widely
      different from each other as happiness and misery. The first--that portion
      over which our flag floated was usually spoken of as "God's Country;" the
      other--that under the baneful shadow of the banner of rebellion--was
      designated by the most opprobrious epithets at the speaker's command.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get from the latter to the former was to attain, at one bound, the
      highest good. Better to be a doorkeeper in the House of the Lord, under
      the Stars and Stripes, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness, under the
      hateful Southern Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take even the humblest and hardest of service in the field now would be
      a delightsome change. We did not ask to go home--we would be content with
      anything, so long as it was in that blest place "within our lines." Only
      let us get back once, and there would be no more grumbling at rations or
      guard duty--we would willingly endure all the hardships and privations
      that soldier flesh is heir to.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two ways of getting back--escape and exchange. Exchange was
      like the ever receding mirage of the desert, that lures the thirsty
      traveler on over the parched sands, with illusions of refreshing springs,
      only to leave his bones at last to whiten by the side of those of his
      unremembered predecessors. Every day there came something to build up the
      hopes that exchange was near at hand--every day brought something to
      extinguish the hopes of the preceding one. We took these varying phases
      according to our several temperaments. The sanguine built themselves up on
      the encouraging reports; the desponding sank down and died under the
      discouraging ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escape was a perpetual allurement. To the actively inclined among us it
      seemed always possible, and daring, busy brains were indefatigable in
      concocting schemes for it. The only bit of Rebel brain work that I ever
      saw for which I did not feel contempt was the perfect precautions taken to
      prevent our escape. This is shown by the fact that, although, from first
      to last, there were nearly fifty thousand prisoners in Andersonville, and
      three out of every five of these were ever on the alert to take French
      leave of their captors, only three hundred and twenty-eight succeeded in
      getting so far away from Andersonville as to leave it to be presumed that
      they had reached our lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, and almost superhuman difficulty was to get outside the
      Stockade. It was simply impossible to scale it. The guards were too close
      together to allow an instant's hope to the most sanguine, that he could
      even pass the Dead Line without being shot by some one of them. This same
      closeness prevented any hope of bribing them. To be successful half those
      on post would have to be bribed, as every part of the Stockade was clearly
      visible from every other part, and there was no night so dark as not to
      allow a plain view to a number of guards of the dark figure outlined
      against the light colored logs of any Yankee who should essay to clamber
      towards the top of the palisades.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates were so carefully guarded every time they were opened as to
      preclude hope of slipping out through theme. They were only unclosed twice
      or thrice a day--once to admit, the men to call the roll, once to let them
      out again, once to let the wagons come in with rations, and once, perhaps,
      to admit, new prisoners. At all these times every precaution was taken to
      prevent any one getting out surreptitiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This narrowed down the possibilities of passing the limits of the pen
      alive, to tunneling. This was also surrounded by almost insuperable
      difficulties. First, it required not less than fifty feet of subterranean
      excavation to get out, which was an enormous work with our limited means.
      Then the logs forming the Stockade were set in the ground to a depth of
      five feet, and the tunnel had to go down beneath them. They had an
      unpleasant habit of dropping down into the burrow under them. It added
      much to the discouragements of tunneling to think of one of these massive
      timbers dropping upon a fellow as he worked his mole-like way under it,
      and either crushing him to death outright, or pinning him there to die of
      suffocation or hunger. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp176"
      id="linkp176"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p176.jpg (14K)" src="images/p176.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In one instance, in a tunnel near me, but in which I was not interested,
      the log slipped down after the digger had got out beyond it. He
      immediately began digging for the surface, for life, and was fortunately
      able to break through before he suffocated. He got his head above the
      ground, and then fainted. The guard outside saw him, pulled him out of the
      hole, and when he recovered sensibility hurried him back into the
      Stockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another tunnel, also near us, a broad-shouldered German, of the Second
      Minnesota, went in to take his turn at digging. He was so much larger than
      any of his predecessors that he stuck fast in a narrow part, and despite
      all the efforts of himself and comrades, it was found impossible to move
      him one way or the other. The comrades were at last reduced to the
      humiliation of informing the Officer of the Guard of their tunnel and the
      condition of their friend, and of asking assistance to release him, which
      was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great tunneling tool was the indispensable half-canteen. The inventive
      genius of our people, stimulated by the war, produced nothing for the
      comfort and effectiveness of the soldier equal in usefulness to this
      humble and unrecognized utensil. It will be remembered that a canteen was
      composed of two pieces of tin struck up into the shape of saucers, and
      soldered together at the edges. After a soldier had been in the field a
      little while, and thrown away or lost the curious and complicated kitchen
      furniture he started out with, he found that by melting the halves of his
      canteen apart, he had a vessel much handier in every way than any he had
      parted with. It could be used for anything --to make soup or coffee in,
      bake bread, brown coffee, stew vegetables, etc., etc. A sufficient handle
      was made with a split stick. When the cooking was done, the handle was
      thrown away, and the half canteen slipped out of the road into the
      haversack. There seemed to be no end of the uses to which this ever-ready
      disk of blackened sheet iron could be turned. Several instances are on
      record where infantry regiments, with no other tools than this, covered
      themselves on the field with quite respectable rifle pits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The starting point of a tunnel was always some tent close to the Dead
      Line, and sufficiently well closed to screen the operations from the sight
      of the guards near by. The party engaged in the work organized by giving
      every man a number to secure the proper apportionment of the labor. Number
      One began digging with his half canteen. After he had worked until tired,
      he came out, and Number Two took his place, and so on. The tunnel was
      simply a round, rat-like burrow, a little larger than a man's body. The
      digger lay on his stomach, dug ahead of him, threw the dirt under him, and
      worked it back with his feet till the man behind him, also lying on his
      stomach, could catch it and work it back to the next. As the tunnel
      lengthened the number of men behind each other in this way had to be
      increased, so that in a tunnel seventy-five feet long there would be from
      eight to ten men lying one behind the other. When the dirt was pushed back
      to the mouth of the tunnel it was taken up in improvised bags, made by
      tying up the bottoms of pantaloon legs, carried to the Swamp, and emptied.
      The work in the tunnel was very exhausting, and the digger had to be
      relieved every half-hour. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp177"
      id="linkp177"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest trouble was to carry the tunnel forward in a straight line.
      As nearly everybody dug most of the time with the right hand, there was an
      almost irresistible tendency to make the course veer to the left. The
      first tunnel I was connected with was a ludicrous illustration of this.
      About twenty of us had devoted our nights for over a week to the
      prolongation of a burrow. We had not yet reached the Stockade, which
      astonished us, as measurement with a string showed that we had gone nearly
      twice the distance necessary for the purpose. The thing was inexplicable,
      and we ceased operations to consider the matter. The next day a man
      walking by a tent some little distance from the one in which the hole
      began, was badly startled by the ground giving way under his feet, and his
      sinking nearly to his waist in a hole. It was very singular, but after
      wondering over the matter for some hours, there came a glimmer of
      suspicion that it might be, in some way, connected with the missing end of
      our tunnel. One of us started through on an exploring expedition, and
      confirmed the suspicions by coming out where the man had broken through.
      Our tunnel was shaped like a horse shoe, and the beginning and end were
      not fifteen feet apart. After that we practised digging with our left
      hand, and made certain compensations for the tendency to the sinister
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another trouble connected with tunneling was the number of traitors and
      spies among us. There were many--principally among the N'Yaarker crowd who
      were always zealous to betray a tunnel, in order to curry favor with the
      Rebel officers. Then, again, the Rebels had numbers of their own men in
      the pen at night, as spies. It was hardly even necessary to dress these in
      our uniform, because a great many of our own men came into the prison in
      Rebel clothes, having been compelled to trade garments with their captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in May, quite an excitement was raised by the detection of one of
      these "tunnel traitors" in such a way as left no doubt of his guilt. At
      first everybody was in favor of killing him, and they actually started to
      beat him to death. This was arrested by a proposition to "have Captain
      Jack tattoo him," and the suggestion was immediately acted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Jack" was a sailor who had been with us in the Pemberton building
      at Richmond. He was a very skilful tattoo artist, but, I am sure, could
      make the process nastier than any other that I ever saw attempt it. He
      chewed tobacco enormously. After pricking away for a few minutes at the
      design on the arm or some portion of the body, he would deluge it with a
      flood of tobacco spit, which, he claimed, acted as a kind of mordant.
      Piping this off with a filthy rag, he would study the effect for an
      instant, and then go ahead with another series of prickings and tobacco
      juice drenchings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tunnel-traitor was taken to Captain Jack. That worthy decided to brand
      him with a great "T," the top part to extend across his forehead and the
      stem to run down his nose. Captain Jack got his tattooing kit ready, and
      the fellow was thrown upon the ground and held there. The Captain took his
      head between his legs, and began operations. After an instant's work with
      the needles, he opened his mouth, and filled the wretch's face and eyes
      full of the disgusting saliva. The crowd round about yelled with delight
      at this new process. For an hour, that was doubtless an eternity to the
      rascal undergoing branding, Captain Jack continued his alternate pickings
      and drenchings. At the end of that time the traitor's face was disfigured
      with a hideous mark that he would bear to his grave. We learned afterwards
      that he was not one of our men, but a Rebel spy. This added much to our
      satisfaction with the manner of his treatment. He disappeared shortly
      after the operation was finished, being, I suppose, taken outside. I
      hardly think Captain Jack would be pleased to meet him again. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      THE HOUNDS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES THEY PUT IN THE WAY OF ESCAPE --THE WHOLE
      SOUTH PATROLLED BY THEM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who succeeded, one way or another, in passing the Stockade limits,
      found still more difficulties lying between them and freedom than would
      discourage ordinarily resolute men. The first was to get away from the
      immediate vicinity of the prison. All around were Rebel patrols, pickets
      and guards, watching every avenue of egress. Several packs of hounds
      formed efficient coadjutors of these, and were more dreaded by possible
      "escapes," than any other means at the command of our jailors. Guards and
      patrols could be evaded, or circumvented, but the hounds could not. Nearly
      every man brought back from a futile attempt at escape told the same
      story: he had been able to escape the human Rebels, but not their canine
      colleagues. Three of our detachment--members of the Twentieth Indiana--had
      an experience of this kind that will serve to illustrate hundreds of
      others. They had been taken outside to do some work upon the cook-house
      that was being built. A guard was sent with the three a little distance
      into the woods to get a piece of timber. The boys sauntered, along
      carelessly with the guard, and managed to get pretty near him. As soon as
      they were fairly out of sight of the rest, the strongest of them--Tom
      Williams--snatched the Rebel's gun away from him, and the other two
      springing upon him as swift as wild cats, throttled him, so that he could
      not give the alarm. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp182" id="linkp182"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p182.jpg (56K)" src="images/p182.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Still keeping a hand on his throat, they led him off some distance, and
      tied him to a sapling with strings made by tearing up one of their
      blouses. He was also securely gagged, and the boys, bidding him a hasty,
      but not specially tender, farewell, struck out, as they fondly hoped, for
      freedom. It was not long until they were missed, and the parties sent in
      search found and released the guard, who gave all the information he
      possessed as to what had become of his charges. All the packs of hounds,
      the squads of cavalry, and the foot patrols were sent out to scour the
      adjacent country. The Yankees kept in the swamps and creeks, and no trace
      of them was found that afternoon or evening. By this time they were ten or
      fifteen miles away, and thought that they could safely leave the creeks
      for better walking on the solid ground. They had gone but a few miles,
      when the pack of hounds Captain Wirz was with took their trail, and came
      after them in full cry. The boys tried to ran, but, exhausted as they
      were, they could make no headway. Two of them were soon caught, but Tom
      Williams, who was so desperate that he preferred death to recapture,
      jumped into a mill-pond near by. When he came up, it was in a lot of saw
      logs and drift wood that hid him from being seen from the shore. The dogs
      stopped at the shore, and bayed after the disappearing prey. The Rebels
      with them, who had seen Tom spring in, came up and made a pretty thorough
      search for him. As they did not think to probe around the drift wood this
      was unsuccessful, and they came to the conclusion that Tom had been
      drowned. Wirz marched the other two back and, for a wonder, did not punish
      them, probably because he was so rejoiced at his success in capturing
      them. He was beaming with delight when he returned them to our squad, and
      said, with a chuckle:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brisoners, I pring you pack two of dem tam Yankees wat got away
      yesterday, unt I run de oder raskal into a mill-pont and trowntet him."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was our astonishment, about three weeks later, to see Tom, fat and
      healthy, and dressed in a full suit of butternut, come stalking into the
      pen. He had nearly reached the mountains, when a pack of hounds,
      patrolling for deserters or negros, took his trail, where he had crossed
      the road from one field to another, and speedily ran him down. He had been
      put in a little country jail, and well fed till an opportunity occurred to
      send him back. This patrolling for negros and deserters was another of the
      great obstacles to a successful passage through the country. The rebels
      had put, every able-bodied white man in the ranks, and were bending every
      energy to keep him there. The whole country was carefully policed by
      Provost Marshals to bring out those who were shirking military duty, or
      had deserted their colors, and to check any movement by the negros. One
      could not go anywhere without a pass, as every road was continually
      watched by men and hounds. It was the policy of our men, when escaping, to
      avoid roads as much as possible by traveling through the woods and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I saw of the hounds, and what I could learn from others, I
      believe that each pack was made up of two bloodhounds and from twenty-five
      to fifty other dogs, The bloodhounds were debased descendants of the
      strong and fierce hounds imported from Cuba--many of them by the United
      States Government--for hunting Indians, during the Seminole war. The other
      dogs were the mongrels that are found in such plentifulness about every
      Southern house--increasing, as a rule, in numbers as the inhabitant of the
      house is lower down and poorer. They are like wolves, sneaking and
      cowardly when alone, fierce and bold when in packs. Each pack was managed
      by a well-armed man, who rode a mule; and carried, slung over his
      shoulders by a cord, a cow horn, scraped very thin, with which he
      controlled the band by signals. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp184"

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What always puzzled me much was why the hounds took only Yankee trails, in
      the vicinity of the prison. There was about the Stockade from six thousand
      to ten thousand Rebels and negros, including guards, officers, servants,
      workmen, etc. These were, of course, continually in motion and must have
      daily made trails leading in every direction. It was the custom of the
      Rebels to send a pack of hounds around the prison every morning, to
      examine if any Yankees had escaped during the night. It was believed that
      they rarely failed to find a prisoner's tracks, and still more rarely ran
      off upon a Rebel's. If those outside the Stockade had been confined to
      certain path and roads we could have understood this, but, as I
      understand, they were not. It was part of the interest of the day, for us,
      to watch the packs go yelping around the pen searching for tracks. We got
      information in this way whether any tunnel had been successfully opened
      during the night. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp185" id="linkp185"></a>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of hounds furnished us a crushing reply to the ever recurring
      Rebel question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you-uns puttin' niggers in the field to fight we-uns for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The questioner was always silenced by the return interrogatory:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that as bad as running white men down with blood hounds?" <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </h2>
    <p>
      MAY--INFLUX OF NEW PRISONERS--DISPARITY IN NUMBERS BETWEEN THE EASTERN AND
      WESTERN ARMIES--TERRIBLE CROWDING--SLAUGHTER OF MEN AT THE CREEK.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May the long gathering storm of war burst with angry violence all along
      the line held by the contending armies. The campaign began which was to
      terminate eleven months later in the obliteration of the Southern
      Confederacy. May 1, Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley with thirty
      thousand men; May 3, Butler began his blundering movement against
      Petersburg; May 3, the Army of the Potomac left Culpeper, and on the 5th
      began its deadly grapple with Lee, in the Wilderness; May 6, Sherman moved
      from Chattanooga, and engaged Joe Johnston at Rocky Face Ridge and Tunnel
      Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these columns lost heavily in prisoners. It could not be
      otherwise; it was a consequence of the aggressive movements. An army
      acting offensively usually suffers more from capture than one on the
      defensive. Our armies were penetrating the enemy's country in close
      proximity to a determined and vigilant foe. Every scout, every skirmish
      line, every picket, every foraging party ran the risk of falling into a
      Rebel trap. This was in addition to the risk of capture in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bulk of the prisoners were taken from the Army of the Potomac. For
      this there were two reasons: First, that there were many more men in that
      Army than in any other; and second, that the entanglement in the dense
      thickets and shrubbery of the Wilderness enabled both sides to capture
      great numbers of the other's men. Grant lost in prisoners from May 5 to
      May 31, seven thousand four hundred and fifty; he probably captured
      two-thirds of that number from the Johnnies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wirz's headquarters were established in a large log house which had been
      built in the fort a little distant from the southeast corner of the
      prison. Every day--and sometimes twice or thrice a day--we would see great
      squads of prisoners marched up to these headquarters, where they would be
      searched, their names entered upon the prison records, by clerks (detailed
      prisoners; few Rebels had the requisite clerical skill) and then be
      marched into the prison. As they entered, the Rebel guards would stand to
      arms. The infantry would be in line of battle, the cavalry mounted, and
      the artillerymen standing by their guns, ready to open at the instant with
      grape and canister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disparity between the number coming in from the Army of the Potomac
      and Western armies was so great, that we Westerners began to take some
      advantage of it. If we saw a squad of one hundred and fifty or thereabouts
      at the headquarters, we felt pretty certain they were from Sherman, and
      gathered to meet them, and learn the news from our friends. If there were
      from five hundred to two thousand we knew they were from the Army of the
      Potomac, and there were none of our comrades among them. There were three
      exceptions to this rule while we were in Andersonville. The first was in
      June, when the drunken and incompetent Sturgis (now Colonel of the Seventh
      United States Cavalry) shamefully sacrificed a superb division at Guntown,
      Miss. The next was after Hood made his desperate attack on Sherman, on the
      22d of July, and the third was when Stoneman was captured at Macon. At
      each of these times about two thousand prisoners were brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of May there were eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four
      prisoners in the Stockade. Before the reader dismisses this statement from
      his mind let him reflect how great a number this is. It is more active,
      able-bodied young men than there are in any of our leading Cities, save
      New York and Philadelphia. It is more than the average population of an
      Ohio County. It is four times as many troops as Taylor won the victory of
      Buena Vista with, and about twice as many as Scott went into battle with
      at any time in his march to the City of Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      These eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four men were cooped up on
      less than thirteen acres of ground, making about fifteen hundred to the
      acre. No room could be given up for streets, or for the usual arrangements
      of a camp, and most kinds of exercise were wholly precluded. The men
      crowded together like pigs nesting in the woods on cold nights. The
      ground, despite all our efforts, became indescribably filthy, and this
      condition grew rapidly worse as the season advanced and the sun's rays
      gained fervency. As it is impossible to describe this adequately, I must
      again ask the reader to assist with a few comparisons. He has an idea of
      how much filth is produced, on an ordinary City lot, in a week, by its
      occupation by a family say of six persons. Now let him imagine what would
      be the result if that lot, instead of having upon it six persons, with
      every appliance for keeping themselves clean, and for removing and
      concealing filth, was the home of one hundred and eight men, with none of
      these appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he may figure out these proportions for himself, I will repeat some
      of the elements of the problem: We will say that an average City lot is
      thirty feet front by one hundred deep. This is more front than most of
      them have, but we will be liberal. This gives us a surface of three
      thousand square feet. An acre contains forty-three thousand five hundred
      and sixty square feet. Upon thirteen of these acres, we had eighteen
      thousand four hundred and fifty-four men. After he has found the number of
      square feet that each man had for sleeping apartment, dining room,
      kitchen, exercise grounds and outhouses, and decided that nobody could
      live for any length of time in such contracted space, I will tell him that
      a few weeks later double that many men were crowded upon that space that
      over thirty-five thousand were packed upon those twelve and a-half or
      thirteen acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will not anticipate. With the warm weather the condition of the
      swamp in the center of the prison became simply horrible. We hear so much
      now-a-days of blood poisoning from the effluvia of sinks and sewers, that
      reading it, I wonder how a man inside the Stockade, and into whose
      nostrils came a breath of that noisomeness, escaped being carried off by a
      malignant typhus. In the slimy ooze were billions of white maggots. They
      would crawl out by thousands on the warm sand, and, lying there a few
      minutes, sprout a wing or a pair of them. With these they would essay a
      clumsy flight, ending by dropping down upon some exposed portion of a
      man's body, and stinging him like a gad-fly. Still worse, they would drop
      into what he was cooking, and the utmost care could not prevent a mess of
      food from being contaminated with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the water that we had to use was that in the creek which flowed
      through this seething mass of corruption, and received its sewerage. How
      pure the water was when it came into the Stockade was a question. We
      always believed that it received the drainage from the camps of the
      guards, a half-a-mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A road was made across the swamp, along the Dead Line at the west side,
      where the creek entered the pen. Those getting water would go to this
      spot, and reach as far up the stream as possible, to get the water that
      was least filthy. As they could reach nearly to the Dead Line this
      furnished an excuse to such of the guards as were murderously inclined to
      fire upon them. I think I hazard nothing in saying that for weeks at least
      one man a day was killed at this place. The murders became monotonous;
      there was a dreadful sameness to them. A gun would crack; looking up we
      would see, still smoking, the muzzle of the musket of one of the guards on
      either side of the creek. At the same instant would rise a piercing shriek
      from the man struck, now floundering in the creek in his death agony. Then
      thousands of throats would yell out curses and denunciations, and--
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, give the Rebel ---- ---- ---- ---- a furlough!" <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was our belief that every guard who killed a Yankee was rewarded with a
      thirty-day furlough. Mr. Frederick Holliger, now of Toledo, formerly a
      member of the Seventy-Second Ohio, and captured at Guntown, tells me, as
      his introduction to Andersonville life, that a few hours after his entry
      he went to the brook to get a drink, reached out too far, and was fired
      upon by the guard, who missed him, but killed another man and wounded a
      second. The other prisoners standing near then attacked him, and beat him
      nearly to death, for having drawn the fire of the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more inexcusable than these murders. Whatever defense
      there might be for firing on men who touched the Dead Line in other parts
      of the prison, there could be none here. The men had no intention of
      escaping; they had no designs upon the Stockade; they were not leading any
      party to assail it. They were in every instance killed in the act of
      reaching out with their cups to dip up a little water. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOLDIERLY DUTY AND MURDER--A PLOT TO ESCAPE --IT
      IS REVEALED AND FRUSTRATED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the reader understand that in any strictures I make I do not complain
      of the necessary hardships of war. I understood fully and accepted the
      conditions of a soldier's career. My going into the field uniformed and
      armed implied an intention, at least, of killing, wounding, or capturing,
      some of the enemy. There was consequently no ground of complaint if I was,
      myself killed, wounded, or captured. If I did not want to take these
      chances I ought to stay at home. In the same way, I recognized the right
      of our captors or guards to take proper precautions to prevent our escape.
      I never questioned for an instant the right of a guard to fire upon those
      attempting to escape, and to kill them. Had I been posted over prisoners I
      should have had no compunction about shooting at those trying to get away,
      and consequently I could not blame the Rebels for doing the same thing. It
      was a matter of soldierly duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not one of the men assassinated by the guards at Andersonville were
      trying to escape, nor could they have got away if not arrested by a
      bullet. In a majority of instances there was not even a transgression of a
      prison rule, and when there was such a transgression it was a mere
      harmless inadvertence. The slaying of every man there was a foul crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most of this was done by very young boys; some of it by old men. The
      Twenty-Sixth Alabama and Fifty-Fifth Georgia, had guarded us since the
      opening of the prison, but now they were ordered to the field, and their
      places filled by the Georgia "Reserves," an organization of boys under,
      and men over the military age. As General Grant aptly-phrased it, "They
      had robbed the cradle and the grave," in forming these regiments. The
      boys, who had grown up from children since the war began, could not
      comprehend that a Yankee was a human being, or that it was any more
      wrongful to shoot one than to kill a mad dog. Their young imaginations had
      been inflamed with stories of the total depravity of the Unionists until
      they believed it was a meritorious thing to seize every opportunity to
      exterminate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one morning I overheard a conversation between two of these youthful
      guards:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Bill, I heerd that you shot a Yank last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you just bet I did. God! you jest ought to've heerd him holler."
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the juvenile murderer had no more conception that he had
      committed crime than if he had killed a rattlesnake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who came in about the last of the month were two thousand men
      from Butler's command, lost in the disastrous action of May 15, by which
      Butler was "bottled up" at Bermuda Hundreds. At that time the Rebel hatred
      for Butler verged on insanity, and they vented this upon these men who
      were so luckless--in every sense--as to be in his command. Every pains was
      taken to mistreat them. Stripped of every article of clothing, equipment,
      and cooking utensils--everything, except a shirt and a pair of pantaloons,
      they were turned bareheaded and barefooted into the prison, and the worst
      possible place in the pen hunted out to locate them upon. This was under
      the bank, at the edge of the Swamp and at the eastern side of the prison,
      where the sinks were, and all filth from the upper part of the camp flowed
      down to them. The sand upon which they lay was dry and burning as that of
      a tropical desert; they were without the slightest shelter of any kind,
      the maggot flies swarmed over them, and the stench was frightful. If one
      of them survived the germ theory of disease is a hallucination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The increasing number of prisoners made it necessary for the Rebels to
      improve their means of guarding and holding us in check. They threw up a
      line of rifle pits around the Stockade for the infantry guards. At
      intervals along this were piles of hand grenades, which could be used with
      fearful effect in case of an outbreak. A strong star fort was thrown up at
      a little distance from the southwest corner. Eleven field pieces were
      mounted in this in such a way as to rake the Stockade diagonally. A
      smaller fort, mounting five guns, was built at the northwest corner, and
      at the northeast and southeast corners were small lunettes, with a couple
      of howitzers each. Packed as we were we had reason to dread a single round
      from any of these works, which could not fail to produce fearful havoc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still a plot was concocted for a break, and it seemed to the sanguine
      portions of us that it must prove successful. First a secret society was
      organized, bound by the most stringent oaths that could be devised. The
      members of this were divided into companies of fifty men each; under
      officers regularly elected. The secrecy was assumed in order to shut out
      Rebel spies and the traitors from a knowledge of the contemplated
      outbreak. A man named Baker--belonging, I think, to some New York
      regiment--was the grand organizer of the scheme. We were careful in each
      of our companies to admit none to membership except such as long
      acquaintance gave us entire confidence in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was to dig large tunnels to the Stockade at various places, and
      then hollow out the ground at the foot of the timbers, so that a half
      dozen or so could be pushed over with a little effort, and make a gap ten
      or twelve feet wide. All these were to be thrown down at a preconcerted
      signal, the companies were to rush out and seize the eleven guns of the
      headquarters fort. The Plymouth Brigade was then to man these and turn
      them on the camp of the Reserves who, it was imagined, would drop their
      arms and take to their heels after receiving a round or so of shell. We
      would gather what arms we could, and place them in the hands of the most
      active and determined. This would give us frown eight to ten thousand
      fairly armed, resolute men, with which we thought we could march to
      Appalachicola Bay, or to Sherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked energetically at our tunnels, which soon began to assume such
      shape as to give assurance that they would answer our expectations in
      opening the prison walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the usual blight to all such enterprises: a spy or a traitor
      revealed everything to Wirz. One day a guard came in, seized Baker and
      took him out. What was done with him I know not; we never heard of him
      after he passed the inner gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately afterward all the Sergeants of detachments were summoned
      outside. There they met Wirz, who made a speech informing them that he
      knew all the details of the plot, and had made sufficient preparations to
      defeat it. The guard had been strongly reinforced, and disposed in such a
      manner as to protect the guns from capture. The Stockade had been secured
      to prevent its falling, even if undermined. He said, in addition, that
      Sherman had been badly defeated by Johnston, and driven back across the
      river, so that any hopes of co-operation by him would be ill-founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Sergeants returned, he caused the following notice to be posted
      on the gates
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTICE.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Not wishing to shed the blood of hundreds, not connected with those who
        concocted a mad plan to force the Stockade, and make in this way their
        escape, I hereby warn the leaders and those who formed themselves into a
        band to carry out this, that I am in possession of all the facts, and
        have made my dispositions accordingly, so as to frustrate it. No choice
        would be left me but to open with grape and canister on the Stockade,
        and what effect this would have, in this densely crowded place, need not
        be told.
      </p>
      <p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The next day a line of tall poles, bearing white flags, were put up at
      some little distance from the Dead Line, and a notice was read to us at
      roll call that if, except at roll call, any gathering exceeding one
      hundred was observed, closer the Stockade than these poles, the guns would
      open with grape and canister without warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of deaths in the Stockade in May was seven hundred and eight,
      about as many as had been killed in Sherman's army during the same time.

    <p>
      JUNE--POSSIBILITIES OF A MURDEROUS CANNONADE--WHAT WAS PROPOSED TO BE DONE
      IN THAT EVENT--A FALSE ALARM--DETERIORATION OF THE RATIONS --FEARFUL
      INCREASE OF MORTALITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Wirz's threat of grape and canister upon the slightest provocation,
      we lived in daily apprehension of some pretext being found for opening the
      guns upon us for a general massacre. Bitter experience had long since
      taught us that the Rebels rarely threatened in vain. Wirz, especially, was
      much more likely to kill without warning, than to warn without killing.
      This was because of the essential weakness of his nature. He knew no art
      of government, no method of discipline save "kill them!" His petty little
      mind's scope reached no further. He could conceive of no other way of
      managing men than the punishment of every offense, or seeming offense,
      with death. Men who have any talent for governing find little occasion for
      the death penalty. The stronger they are in themselves--the more fitted
      for controlling others--the less their need of enforcing their authority
      by harsh measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general expression of determination among the prisoners to
      answer any cannonade with a desperate attempt to force the Stockade. It
      was agreed that anything was better than dying like rats in a pit or wild
      animals in a battue. It was believed that if anything would occur which
      would rouse half those in the pen to make a headlong effort in concert,
      the palisade could be scaled, and the gates carried, and, though it would
      be at a fearful loss of life, the majority of those making the attempt
      would get out. If the Rebels would discharge grape and canister, or throw
      a shell into the prison, it would lash everybody to such a pitch that they
      would see that the sole forlorn hope of safety lay in wresting the arms
      away from our tormentors. The great element in our favor was the shortness
      of the distance between us and the cannon. We could hope to traverse this
      before the guns could be reloaded more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it would have been possible to succeed I am unable to say. It
      would have depended wholly upon the spirit and unanimity with which the
      effort was made. Had ten thousand rushed forward at once, each with a
      determination to do or die, I think it would have been successful without
      a loss of a tenth of the number. But the insuperable trouble--in our
      disorganized state--was want of concert of action. I am quite sure,
      however, that the attempt would have been made had the guns opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, while the agitation of this matter was feverish, I was cooking my
      dinner--that is, boiling my pitiful little ration of unsalted meal, in my
      fruit can, with the aid of a handful of splinters that I had been able to
      pick up by a half day's diligent search. Suddenly the long rifle in the
      headquarters fort rang out angrily. A fuse shell shrieked across the
      prison--close to the tops of the logs, and burst in the woods beyond. It
      was answered with a yell of defiance from ten thousand throats.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang up-my heart in my mouth. The long dreaded time had arrived; the
      Rebels had opened the massacre in which they must exterminate us, or we
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked across to the opposite bank, on which were standing twelve
      thousand men--erect, excited, defiant. I was sure that at the next shot
      they would surge straight against the Stockade like a mighty human billow,
      and then a carnage would begin the like of which modern times had never
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement and suspense were terrible. We waited for what seemed ages
      for the next gun. It was not fired. Old Winder was merely showing the
      prisoners how he could rally the guards to oppose an outbreak. Though the
      gun had a shell in it, it was merely a signal, and the guards came
      double-quicking up by regiments, going into position in the rifle pits and
      the hand-grenade piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we realized what the whole affair meant, we relieved our surcharged
      feelings with a few general yells of execration upon Rebels generally, and
      upon those around us particularly, and resumed our occupation of cooking
      rations, killing lice, and discussing the prospects of exchange and
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rations, like everything else about us, had steadily grown worse. A
      bakery was built outside of the Stockade in May and our meal was baked
      there into loaves about the size of brick. Each of us got a half of one of
      these for a day's ration. This, and occasionally a small slice of salt
      pork, was call that I received. I wish the reader would prepare himself an
      object lesson as to how little life can be supported on for any length of
      time, by procuring a piece of corn bread the size of an ordinary brickbat,
      and a thin slice of pork, and then imagine how he would fare, with that as
      his sole daily ration, for long hungry weeks and months. Dio Lewis
      satisfied himself that he could sustain life on sixty cents, a week. I am
      sure that the food furnished us by the Rebels would not, at present prices
      cost one-third that. They pretended to give us one-third of pound of bacon
      and one and one-fourth pounds of corn meal. A week's rations then would be
      two and one-third pounds of bacon--worth ten cents, and eight and
      three-fourths pounds of meal, worth, say, ten cents more. As a matter of
      fact, I do not presume that at any time we got this full ration. It would
      surprise me to learn that we averaged two-thirds of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was ground very coarse and produced great irrition in the bowels.
      We used to have the most frightful cramps that men ever suffered from.
      Those who were predisposed intestinal affections were speedily carried off
      by incurable diarrhea and dysentery. Of the twelve thousand and twelve men
      who died, four thousand died of chronic diarrhea; eight hundred and
      seventeen died of acute diarrhea, and one thousand three hundred and
      eighty-four died of dysenteria, making total of six thousand two hundred
      and one victims to enteric disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the reader reflect a moment upon this number, till comprehends fully
      how many six thousand two hundred and men are, and how much force, energy,
      training, and rich possibilities for the good of the community and country
      died with those six thousand two hundred and one young, active men. It may
      help his perception of the magnitude of this number to remember that the
      total loss of the British, during the Crimean war, by death in all shapes,
      was four thousand five hundred and ninety-five, or one thousand seven
      hundred and six less than the deaths in Andersonville from dysenteric
      diseases alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loathsome maggot flies swarmed about the bakery, and dropped into the
      trough where the dough was being mixed, so that it was rare to get a
      ration of bread not contaminated with a few of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long until the bakery became inadequate to supply bread for all
      the prisoners. Then great iron kettles were set, and mush was issued to a
      number of detachments, instead of bread. There was not so much cleanliness
      and care in preparing this as a farmer shows in cooking food for stock. A
      deep wagon-bed would be shoveled full of the smoking paste, which was then
      hailed inside and issued out to the detachments, the latter receiving it
      on blankets, pieces of shelter tents, or, lacking even these, upon the
      bare sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As still more prisoners came in, neither bread nor mush could be furnished
      them, and a part of the detachments received their rations in meal.
      Earnest solicitation at length resulted in having occasional scanty issues
      of wood to cook this with. My detachment was allowed to choose which it
      would take--bread, mush or meal. It took the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooking the meal was the topic of daily interest. There were three ways of
      doing it: Bread, mush and "dumplings." In the latter the meal was dampened
      until it would hold together, and was rolled into little balls, the size
      of marbles, which were then boiled. The bread was the most satisfactory
      and nourishing; the mush the bulkiest--it made a bigger show, but did not
      stay with one so long. The dumplings held an intermediate position--the
      water in which they were boiled becoming a sort of a broth that helped to
      stay the stomach. We received no salt, as a rule. No one knows the intense
      longing for this, when one goes without it for a while. When, after a
      privation of weeks we would get a teaspoonful of salt apiece, it seemed as
      if every muscle in our bodies was invigorated. We traded buttons to the
      guards for red peppers, and made our mush, or bread, or dumplings, hot
      with the fiery-pods, in hopes that this would make up for the lack of
      salt, but it was a failure. One pinch of salt was worth all the pepper
      pods in the Southern Confederacy. My little squad--now diminished by death
      from five to three--cooked our rations together to economize wood and
      waste of meal, and quarreled among ourselves daily as to whether the joint
      stock should be converted into bread, mush or dumplings. The decision
      depended upon the state of the stomach. If very hungry, we made mush; if
      less famished, dumplings; if disposed to weigh matters, bread. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This may seem a trifling matter, but it was far from it. We all remember
      the man who was very fond of white beans, but after having fifty or sixty
      meals of them in succession, began to find a suspicion of monotony in the
      provender. We had now six months of unvarying diet of corn meal and water,
      and even so slight a change as a variation in the way of combining the two
      was an agreeable novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of June there were twenty-six thousand three hundred and
      sixty-seven prisoners in the Stockade, and one thousand two hundred--just
      forty per day--had died during the month. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      DYING BY INCHES--SEITZ, THE SLOW, AND HIS DEATH--STIGGALL AND EMERSON
      --RAVAGES ON THE SCURVY.
    </p>
    <p>
      May and June made sad havoc in the already thin ranks of our battalion.
      Nearly a score died in my company--L--and the other companies suffered
      proportionately. Among the first to die of my company comrades, was a
      genial little Corporal, "Billy" Phillips--who was a favorite with us all.
      Everything was done for him that kindness could suggest, but it was of
      little avail. Then "Bruno" Weeks--a young boy, the son of a preacher, who
      had run away from his home in Fulton County, Ohio, to join us, succumbed
      to hardship and privation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next to go was good-natured, harmless Victor Seitz, a Detroit cigar
      maker, a German, and one of the slowest of created mortals. How he ever
      came to go into the cavalry was beyond the wildest surmises of his
      comrades. Why his supernatural slowness and clumsiness did not result in
      his being killed at least once a day, while in the service, was even still
      farther beyond the power of conjecture. No accident ever happened in the
      company that Seitz did not have some share in. Did a horse fall on a
      slippery road, it was almost sure to be Seitz's, and that imported son of
      the Fatherland was equally sure to be caught under him. Did somebody
      tumble over a bank of a dark night, it was Seitz that we soon heard making
      his way back, swearing in deep German gutterals, with frequent allusion to
      'tausend teuflin.' Did a shanty blow down, we ran over and pulled Seitz
      out of the debris, when he would exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zo! dot vos pretty vunny now, ain't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he surveyed the scene of his trouble with true German phlegm, he
      would fish a brier-wood pipe from the recesses of his pockets, fill it
      with tobacco, and go plodding off in a cloud of smoke in search of some
      fresh way to narrowly escape destruction. He did not know enough about
      horses to put a snaffle-bit in one's mouth, and yet he would draw the
      friskiest, most mettlesome animal in the corral, upon whose back he was
      scarcely more at home than he would be upon a slack rope. It was no
      uncommon thing to see a horse break out of ranks, and go past the
      battalion like the wind, with poor Seitz clinging to his mane like the
      traditional grim Death to a deceased African. We then knew that Seitz had
      thoughtlessly sunk the keen spurs he would persist in wearing; deep into
      the flanks of his high-mettled animal. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a
      name="linkp201" id="linkp201"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p201.jpg (25K)" src="images/p201.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These accidents became so much a matter-of-course that when anything
      unusual occurred in the company our first impulse was to go and help Seitz
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bugle sounded "boots and saddles," the rest of us would pack up,
      mount, "count off by fours from the right," and be ready to move out
      before the last notes of the call had fairly died away. Just then we would
      notice an unsaddled horse still tied to the hitching place. It was
      Seitz's, and that worthy would be seen approaching, pipe in mouth, and
      bridle in hand, with calm, equable steps, as if any time before the
      expiration of his enlistment would be soon enough to accomplish the
      saddling of his steed. A chorus of impatient and derisive remarks would go
      up from his impatient comrades:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For heaven's sake, Seitz, hurry up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seitz! you are like a cow's tail--always behind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seitz, you are slower than the second coming of the Savior!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christmas is a railroad train alongside of you, Seitz!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you ain't on that horse in half a second, Seitz, we'll go off and
      leave you, and the Johnnies will skin you alive!" etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a ripple of emotion would roll over Seitz's placid features under the
      sharpest of these objurgations. At last, losing all patience, two or three
      boys would dismount, run to Seitz's horse, pack, saddle and bridle him, as
      if he were struck with a whirlwind. Then Seitz would mount, and we would
      move 'off.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all this, we liked him. His good nature was boundless, and his
      disposition to oblige equal to the severest test. He did not lack a grain
      of his full share of the calm, steadfast courage of his race, and would
      stay where he was put, though Erebus yawned and bade him fly. He was very
      useful, despite his unfitness for many of the duties of a cavalryman. He
      was a good guard, and always ready to take charge of prisoners, or be
      sentry around wagons or a forage pile-duties that most of the boys
      cordially hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he came into the last trouble at Andersonville. He stood up pretty
      well under the hardships of Belle Isle, but lost his cheerfulness--his
      unrepining calmness--after a few weeks in the Stockade. One day we
      remembered that none of us had seen him for several days, and we started
      in search of him. We found him in a distant part of the camp, lying near
      the Dead Line. His long fair hair was matted together, his blue eyes had
      the flush of fever. Every part of his clothing was gray with the lice that
      were hastening his death with their torments. He uttered the first
      complaint I ever heard him make, as I came up to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Gott, M ----, dis is worse dun a dog's det!" <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a
      name="linkp203" id="linkp203"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p203.jpg (55K)" src="images/p203.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days we gave him all the funeral in our power; tied his big toes
      together, folded his hands across his breast, pinned to his shirt a slip
      of paper, upon which was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      VICTOR E. SEITZ,
    </p>
    <p>
      Co. L, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And laid his body at the South Gate, beside some scores of others that
      were awaiting the arrival of the six-mule wagon that hauled them to the
      Potter's Field, which was to be their last resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Emerson and John Stiggall, of my company, were two Norwegian boys,
      and fine specimens of their race--intelligent, faithful, and always ready
      for duty. They had an affection for each other that reminded one of the
      stories told of the sworn attachment and the unfailing devotion that were
      common between two Gothic warrior youths. Coming into Andersonville some
      little time after the rest of us, they found all the desirable ground
      taken up, and they established their quarters at the base of the hill,
      near the Swamp. There they dug a little hole to lie in, and put in a layer
      of pine leaves. Between them they had an overcoat and a blanket. At night
      they lay upon the coat and covered themselves with the blanket. By day the
      blanket served as a tent. The hardships and annoyances that we endured
      made everybody else cross and irritable. At times it seemed impossible to
      say or listen to pleasant words, and nobody was ever allowed to go any
      length of time spoiling for a fight. He could usually be accommodated upon
      the spot to any extent he desired, by simply making his wishes known. Even
      the best of chums would have sharp quarrels and brisk fights, and this
      disposition increased as disease made greater inroads upon them. I saw in
      one instance two brothers-both of whom died the next day of scurvy--and
      who were so helpless as to be unable to rise, pull themselves up on their
      knees by clenching the poles of their tents --in order to strike each
      other with clubs, and they kept striking until the bystanders interfered
      and took their weapons away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Stiggall and Emerson never quarreled with each other. Their tenderness
      and affection were remarkable to witness. They began to go the way that so
      many were going; diarrhea and scurvy set in; they wasted away till their
      muscles and tissues almost disappeared, leaving the skin lying fiat upon
      the bones; but their principal solicitude was for each other, and each
      seemed actually jealous of any person else doing anything for the other. I
      met Emerson one day, with one leg drawn clear out of shape, and rendered
      almost useless by the scurvy. He was very weak, but was hobbling down
      towards the Creek with a bucket made from a boot leg. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johnny, just give me your bucket. I'll fill it for you, and bring it up
      to your tent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; much obliged, M ----" he wheezed out; "my pardner wants a cool drink,
      and I guess I'd better get it for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stiggall died in June. He was one of the first victims of scurvy, which,
      in the succeeding few weeks, carried off so many. All of us who had read
      sea-stories had read much of this disease and its horrors, but we had
      little conception of the dreadful reality. It usually manifested itself
      first in the mouth. The breath became unbearably fetid; the gums swelled
      until they protruded, livid and disgusting, beyond the lips. The teeth
      became so loose that they frequently fell out, and the sufferer would pick
      them up and set them back in their sockets. In attempting to bite the hard
      corn bread furnished by the bakery the teeth often stuck fast and were
      pulled out. The gums had a fashion of breaking away, in large chunks,
      which would be swallowed or spit out. All the time one was eating his
      mouth would be filled with blood, fragments of gums and loosened teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightful, malignant ulcers appeared in other parts of the body; the
      ever-present maggot flies laid eggs in these, and soon worms swarmed
      therein. The sufferer looked and felt as if, though he yet lived and
      moved, his body was anticipating the rotting it would undergo a little
      later in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last change was ushered in by the lower parts of the legs swelling.
      When this appeared, we considered the man doomed. We all had scurvy, more
      or less, but as long as it kept out of our legs we were hopeful. First,
      the ankle joints swelled, then the foot became useless. The swelling
      increased until the knees became stiff, and the skin from these down was
      distended until it looked pale, colorless and transparent as a tightly
      blown bladder. The leg was so much larger at the bottom than at the thigh,
      that the sufferers used to make grim jokes about being modeled like a
      churn, "with the biggest end down." The man then became utterly helpless
      and usually died in a short time. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp205"

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The official report puts down the number of deaths from scurvy at three
      thousand five hundred and seventy-four, but Dr. Jones, the Rebel surgeon,
      reported to the Rebel Government his belief that nine-tenths of the great
      mortality of the prison was due, either directly or indirectly, to this
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only effort made by the Rebel doctors to check its ravages was
      occasionally to give a handful of sumach berries to some particularly bad
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Stiggall died we thought Emerson would certainly follow him in a day
      or two, but, to our surprise, he lingered along until August before dying.

      "OLE BOO," AND "OLE SOL, THE HAYMAKER"--A FETID, BURNING DESERT--NOISOME
      WATER, AND THE EFFECTS OF DRINKING IT--STEALING SOFT SOAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gradually lengthening Summer days were insufferably long and
      wearisome. Each was hotter, longer and more tedious than its predecessors.
      In my company was a none-too-bright fellow, named Dawson. During the
      chilly rains or the nipping, winds of our first days in prison, Dawson
      would, as he rose in, the morning, survey the forbidding skies with
      lack-luster eyes and remark, oracularly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Ole Boo gits us agin, to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so unvarying in this salutation to the morn that his designation of
      disagreeable weather as "Ole Boo" became generally adopted by us. When the
      hot weather came on, Dawson's remark, upon rising and seeing excellent
      prospects for a scorcher, changed to: "Well, Ole Sol, the Haymaker, is
      going to git in his work on us agin to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as he lived and was able to talk, this was Dawson's invariable
      observation at the break of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite right. The Ole Haymaker would do some famous work before he
      descended in the West, sending his level rays through the wide interstices
      between the somber pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nine o'clock in the morning his beams would begin to fairly singe
      everything in the crowded pen. The hot sand would glow as one sees it in
      the center of the unshaded highway some scorching noon in August. The high
      walls of the prison prevented the circulation inside of any breeze that
      might be in motion, while the foul stench rising from the putrid Swamp and
      the rotting ground seemed to reach the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can readily comprehend the horrors of death on the burning sands of a
      desert. But the desert sand is at least clean; there is nothing worse
      about it than heat and intense dryness. It is not, as that was at
      Andersonville, poisoned with the excretions of thousands of sick and dying
      men, filled with disgusting vermin, and loading the air with the germs of
      death. The difference is as that between a brick-kiln and a sewer. Should
      the fates ever decide that I shall be flung out upon sands to perish, I
      beg that the hottest place in the Sahara may be selected, rather than such
      a spot as the interior of the Andersonville Stockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be said that we had an abundance of water, which made a decided
      improvement on a desert. Doubtless--had that water been pure. But every
      mouthful of it was a blood poison, and helped promote disease and death.
      Even before reaching the Stockade it was so polluted by the drainage of
      the Rebel camps as to be utterly unfit for human use. In our part of the
      prison we sank several wells--some as deep as forty feet--to procure
      water. We had no other tools for this than our ever-faithful half
      canteens, and nothing wherewith to wall the wells. But a firm clay was
      reached a few feet below the surface, which afforded tolerable strong
      sides for the lower part, ana furnished material to make adobe bricks for
      curbs to keep out the sand of the upper part. The sides were continually
      giving away, however, and fellows were perpetually falling down the holes,
      to the great damage of their legs and arms. The water, which was drawn up
      in little cans, or boot leg buckets, by strings made of strips of cloth,
      was much better than that of the creek, but was still far from pure, as it
      contained the seepage from the filthy ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intense heat led men to drink great quantities of water, and this
      superinduced malignant dropsical complaints, which, next to diarrhea,
      scurvy and gangrene, were the ailments most active in carrying men off.
      Those affected in this way swelled up frightfully from day to day. Their
      clothes speedily became too small for them, and were ripped off, leaving
      them entirely naked, and they suffered intensely until death at last came
      to their relief. Among those of my squad who died in this way, was a young
      man named Baxter, of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry, taken at Chicamauga. He
      was very fine looking--tall, slender, with regular features and intensely
      black hair and eyes; he sang nicely, and was generally liked. A more
      pitiable object than he, when last I saw him, just before his death, can
      not be imagined. His body had swollen until it seemed marvelous that the
      human skin could bear so much distention without disruption, All the old
      look of bright intelligence had been. driven from his face by the
      distortion of his features. His swarthy hair and beard, grown long and
      ragged, had that peculiar repulsive look which the black hair of the sick
      is prone to assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attributed much of my freedom from the diseases to which others
      succumbed to abstention from water drinking. Long before I entered the
      army, I had constructed a theory--on premises that were doubtless as
      insufficient as those that boyish theories are usually based upon--that
      drinking water was a habit, and a pernicious one, which sapped away the
      energy. I took some trouble to curb my appetite for water, and soon found
      that I got along very comfortably without drinking anything beyond that
      which was contained in my food. I followed this up after entering the
      army, drinking nothing at any time but a little coffee, and finding no
      need, even on the dustiest marches, for anything more. I do not presume
      that in a year I drank a quart of cold water. Experience seemed to confirm
      my views, for I noticed that the first to sink under a fatigue, or to
      yield to sickness, were those who were always on the lookout for drinking
      water, springing from their horses and struggling around every well or
      spring on the line of march for an opportunity to fill their canteens.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made liberal use of the Creek for bathing purposes, however, visiting it
      four or five times a day during the hot days, to wash myself all over.
      This did not cool one off much, for the shallow stream was nearly as hot
      as the sand, but it seemed to do some good, and it helped pass away the
      tedious hours. The stream was nearly all the time filled as full of
      bathers as they could stand, and the water could do little towards
      cleansing so many. The occasional rain storms that swept across the prison
      were welcomed, not only because they cooled the air temporarily, but
      because they gave us a shower-bath. As they came up, nearly every one
      stripped naked and got out where he could enjoy the full benefit of the
      falling water. Fancy, if possible, the spectacle of twenty-five thousand
      or thirty thousand men without a stitch of clothing upon them. The like
      has not been seen, I imagine, since the naked followers of Boadicea
      gathered in force to do battle to the Roman invaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to get really clean. Our bodies seemed covered with a
      varnish-like, gummy matter that defied removal by water alone. I imagined
      that it came from the rosin or turpentine, arising from the little pitch
      pine fires over which we hovered when cooking our rations. It would yield
      to nothing except strong soap-and soap, as I have before stated--was
      nearly as scarce in the Southern Confederacy as salt. We in prison saw
      even less of it, or rather, none at all. The scarcity of it, and our
      desire for it, recalls a bit of personal experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had steadfastly refused all offers of positions outside the prison on
      parole, as, like the great majority of the prisoners, my hatred of the
      Rebels grew more bitter, day by day; I felt as if I would rather die than
      accept the smallest favor at their hands, and I shared the common contempt
      for those who did. But, when the movement for a grand attack on the
      Stockade--mentioned in a previous chapter--was apparently rapidly coming
      to a head, I was offered a temporary detail outside to, assist in making
      up some rolls. I resolved to accept; first because I thought I might get
      some information that would be of use in our enterprise; and, next,
      because I foresaw that the rush through the gaps in the Stockade would be
      bloody business, and by going out in advance I would avoid that much of
      the danger, and still be able to give effective assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was taken up to Wirz's office. He was writing at a desk at one end of a
      large room when the Sergeant brought me in. He turned around, told the
      Sergeant to leave me, and ordered me to sit down upon a box at the other
      end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his back and resuming his writing, in a few minutes he had
      forgotten me. I sat quietly, taking in the details for a half-hour, and
      then, having exhausted everything else in the room, I began wondering what
      was in the box I was sitting upon. The lid was loose; I hitched it forward
      a little without attracting Wirz's attention, and slipped my left hand
      down of a voyage of discovery. It seemed very likely that there was
      something there that a loyal Yankee deserved better than a Rebel. I found
      that it was a fine article of soft soap. A handful was scooped up and
      speedily shoved into my left pantaloon pocket. Expecting every instant
      that Wirz would turn around and order me to come to the desk to show my
      handwriting, hastily and furtively wiped my hand on the back of my shirt
      and watched Wirz with as innocent an expression as a school boy assumes
      when he has just flipped a chewed paper wad across the room. Wirz was
      still engrossed in his writing, and did not look around. I was emboldened
      to reach down for another handful. This was also successfully transferred,
      the hand wiped off on the back of the shirt, and the face wore its
      expression of infantile ingenuousness. Still Wirz did not look up. I kept
      dipping up handful after handful, until I had gotten about a quart in the
      left hand pocket. After each handful I rubbed my hand off on the back of
      my shirt and waited an instant for a summons to the desk. Then the process
      was repeated with the other hand, and a quart of the saponaceous mush was
      packed in the right hand pocket. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp211"
      id="linkp211"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p211.jpg (33K)" src="images/p211.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after Wirz rose and ordered a guard to take me away and keep me,
      until he decided what to do with me. The day was intensely hot, and soon
      the soap in my pockets and on the back of my shirt began burning like
      double strength Spanish fly blisters. There was nothing to do but grin and
      bear it. I set my teeth, squatted down under the shade of the parapet of
      the fort, and stood it silently and sullenly. For the first time in my
      life I thoroughly appreciated the story of the Spartan boy, who stole the
      fox and suffered the animal to tear his bowels out rather than give a sign
      which would lead to the exposure of his theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between four and five o'clock-after I had endured the thing for five or
      six hours, a guard came with orders from Wirz that I should be returned to
      the Stockade. Upon hastily removing my clothes, after coming inside, I
      found I had a blister on each thigh, and one down my back, that would have
      delighted an old practitioner of the heroic school. But I also had a half
      gallon of excellent soft soap. My chums and I took a magnificent wash, and
      gave our clothes the same, and we still had soap enough left to barter for
      some onions that we had long coveted, and which tasted as sweet to us as
      manna to the Israelites. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      "POUR PASSER LE TEMPS"--A SET OF CHESSMEN PROCURED UNDER DIFFICULTIES
      --RELIGIOUS SERVICES--THE DEVOTED PRIEST--WAR SONG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time moved with leaden feet. Do the best we could, there were very
      many tiresome hours for which no occupation whatever could be found. All
      that was necessary to be done during the day--attending roll call, drawing
      and cooking rations, killing lice and washing--could be disposed of in an
      hour's time, and we were left with fifteen or sixteen waking hours, for
      which there was absolutely no employment. Very many tried to escape both
      the heat and ennui by sleeping as much as possible through the day, but I
      noticed that those who did this soon died, and consequently I did not do
      it. Card playing had sufficed to pass away the hours at first, but our
      cards soon wore out, and deprived us of this resource. My chum, Andrews,
      and I constructed a set of chessmen with an infinite deal of trouble. We
      found a soft, white root in the swamp which answered our purpose. A boy
      near us had a tolerably sharp pocket-knife, for the use of which a couple
      of hours each day, we gave a few spoonfuls of meal. The knife was the only
      one among a large number of prisoners, as the Rebel guards had an
      affection for that style of cutlery, which led them to search incoming
      prisoners, very closely. The fortunate owner of this derived quite a
      little income of meal by shrewdly loaning it to his knifeless comrades.
      The shapes that we made for pieces and pawns were necessarily very rude,
      but they were sufficiently distinct for identification. We blackened one
      set with pitch pine soot, found a piece of plank that would answer for a
      board and purchased it from its possessor for part of a ration of meal,
      and so were fitted out with what served until our release to distract our
      attention from much of the surrounding misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one else procured such amusement as they could. Newcomers, who still
      had money and cards, gambled as long as their means lasted. Those who had
      books read them until the leaves fell apart. Those who had paper and pen
      and ink tried to write descriptions and keep journals, but this was
      usually given up after being in prison a few weeks. I was fortunate enough
      to know a boy who had brought a copy of "Gray's Anatomy" into prison with
      him. I was not specially interested in the subject, but it was Hobson's
      choice; I could read anatomy or nothing, and so I tackled it with such
      good will that before my friend became sick and was taken outside, and his
      book with him, I had obtained a very fair knowledge of the rudiments of
      physiology.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little band of devoted Christian workers, among whom were
      Orderly Sergeant Thomas J. Sheppard, Ninety-Seventh O. Y. L, now a leading
      Baptist minister in Eastern Ohio; Boston Corbett, who afterward slew John
      Wilkes Booth, and Frank Smith, now at the head of the Railroad Bethel work
      at Toledo. They were indefatigable in trying to evangelize the prison. A
      few of them would take their station in some part of the Stockade (a
      different one every time), and begin singing some old familiar hymn like:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Thou fount of every blessing,"
    </p>
    <p>
      and in a few minutes they would have an attentive audience of as many
      thousand as could get within hearing. The singing would be followed by
      regular services, during which Sheppard, Smith, Corbett, and some others
      would make short, spirited, practical addresses, which no doubt did much
      good to all who heard them, though the grains of leaven were entirely too
      small to leaven such an immense measure of meal. They conducted several
      funerals, as nearly like the way it was done at home as possible. Their
      ministrations were not confined to mere lip service, but they labored
      assiduously in caring for the sick, and made many a poor fellow's way to
      the grave much smoother for him. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp215"

      This was about all the religious services that we were favored with. The
      Rebel preachers did not make that effort to save our misguided souls which
      one would have imagined they would having us where we could not choose but
      hear they might have taken advantage of our situation to rake us fore and
      aft with their theological artillery. They only attempted it in one
      instance. While in Richmond a preacher came into our room and announced in
      an authoritative way that he would address us on religious subjects. We
      uncovered respectfully, and gathered around him. He was a loud-tongued,
      brawling Boanerges, who addressed the Lord as if drilling a brigade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke but a few moments before making apparent his belief that the
      worst of crimes was that of being a Yankee, and that a man must not only
      be saved through Christ's blood, but also serve in the Rebel army before
      he could attain to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we raised such a yell of derision that the sermon was brought to
      an abrupt conclusion.

      The only minister who came into the Stockade was a Catholic priest,
      middle-aged, tall, slender, and unmistakably devout. He was unwearied in
      his attention to the sick, and the whole day could be seen moving around
      through the prison, attending to those who needed spiritual consolation.
      It was interesting to see him administer the extreme unction to a dying
      man. Placing a long purple scarf about his own neck and a small brazen
      crucifix in the hands of the dying one, he would kneel by the latter's
      side and anoint him upon the eyes, ears, nostrils; lips, hands, feet and
      breast, with sacred oil; from a little brass vessel, repeating the while,
      in an impressive voice, the solemn offices of the Church. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      His unwearying devotion gained the admiration of all, no matter how little
      inclined one might be to view priestliness generally with favor. He was
      evidently of such stuff as Christian heros have ever been made of, and
      would have faced stake and fagot, at the call of duty, with unquailing
      eye. His name was Father Hamilton, and he was stationed at Macon. The
      world should know more of a man whose services were so creditable to
      humanity and his Church:
    </p>
    <p>
      The good father had the wisdom of the serpent, with the harmlessness of
      the dove. Though full of commiseration for the unhappy lot of the
      prisoners, nothing could betray him into the slightest expression of
      opinion regarding the war or those who were the authors of all this
      misery. In our impatience at our treatment, and hunger for news, we forgot
      his sacerdotal character, and importuned him for tidings of the exchange.
      His invariable reply was that he lived apart from these things and kept
      himself ignorant of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, father," said I one day, with an impatience that I could not wholly
      repress, "you must certainly hear or read something of this, while you are
      outside among the Rebel officers." Like many other people, I supposed that
      the whole world was excited over that in which I felt a deep interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my son," replied he, in his usual calm, measured tones. "I go not
      among them, nor do I hear anything from them. When I leave the prison in
      the evening, full of sorrow at what I have seen here, I find that the best
      use I can make of my time is in studying the Word of God, and especially
      the Psalms of David."
    </p>
    <p>
      We were not any longer good company for each other. We had heard over and
      over again all each other's stories and jokes, and each knew as much about
      the other's previous history as we chose to communicate. The story of
      every individual's past life, relations, friends, regiment, and soldier
      experience had been told again and again, until the repetition was
      wearisome. The cool nights following the hot days were favorable to little
      gossiping seances like the yarn-spinning watches of sailors on pleasant
      nights. Our squad, though its stock of stories was worn threadbare, was
      fortunate enough to have a sweet singer in Israel "Nosey" Payne--of whose
      tunefulness we never tired. He had a large repertoire of patriotic songs,
      which he sang with feeling and correctness, and which helped much to make
      the calm Summer nights pass agreeably. Among the best of these was "Brave
      Boys are They," which I always thought was the finest ballad, both in
      poetry and music, produced by the War. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      MAGGOTS, LICE AND RAIDERS--PRACTICES OF THESE HUMAN VERMIN--PLUNDERING THE
      SICK AND DYING--NIGHT ATTACKS, AND BATTLES BY DAY--HARD TIMES FOR THE
      SMALL TRADERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      With each long, hot Summer hour the lice, the maggot-flies and the
      N'Yaarkers increased in numbers and venomous activity. They were
      ever-present annoyances and troubles; no time was free from them. The lice
      worried us by day and tormented us by night; the maggot-flies fouled our
      food, and laid in sores and wounds larvae that speedily became masses of
      wriggling worms. The N'Yaarkers were human vermin that preyed upon and
      harried us unceasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They formed themselves into bands numbering from five to twenty-five, each
      led by a bold, unscrupulous, energetic scoundrel. We now called them
      "Raiders," and the most prominent and best known of the bands were called
      by the names of their ruffian leaders, as "Mosby's Raiders," "Curtis's
      Raiders," "Delaney's Raiders," "Sarsfield's Raiders," "Collins's Raiders,"
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as we old prisoners formed the bulk of those inside the Stockade,
      the Raiders had slender picking. They would occasionally snatch a blanket
      from the tent poles, or knock a boy down at the Creek and take his silver
      watch from him; but this was all. Abundant opportunities for securing
      richer swag came to them with the advent of the Plymouth Pilgrims. As had
      been before stated, these boys brought in with them a large portion of
      their first instalment of veteran bounty--aggregating in amount, according
      to varying estimates, between twenty-five thousand and one hundred
      thousand dollars. The Pilgrims were likewise well clothed, had an
      abundance of blankets and camp equipage, and a plentiful supply of
      personal trinkets, that could be readily traded off to the Rebels. An
      average one of them--even if his money were all gone--was a bonanza to any
      band which could succeed in plundering him. His watch and chain, shoes,
      knife, ring, handkerchief, combs and similar trifles, would net several
      hundred dollars in Confederate money. The blockade, which cut off the
      Rebel communication with the outer world, made these in great demand. Many
      of the prisoners that came in from the Army of the Potomac repaid robbing
      equally well. As a rule those from that Army were not searched so closely
      as those from the West, and not unfrequently they came in with all their
      belongings untouched, where Sherman's men, arriving the same day, would be
      stripped nearly to the buff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods of the Raiders were various, ranging all the way from sneak
      thievery to highway robbery. All the arts learned in the prisons and
      purlieus of New York were put into exercise. Decoys, "bunko-steerers" at
      home, would be on the look-out for promising subjects as each crowd of
      fresh prisoners entered the gate, and by kindly offers to find them a
      sleeping place, lure them to where they could be easily despoiled during
      the night. If the victim resisted there was always sufficient force at
      hand to conquer him, and not seldom his life paid the penalty of his
      contumacy. I have known as many as three of these to be killed in a night,
      and their bodies--with throats cut, or skulls crushed in--be found in the
      morning among the dead at the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      All men having money or valuables were under continual espionage, and when
      found in places convenient for attack, a rush was made for them. They were
      knocked down and their persons rifled with such swift dexterity that it
      was done before they realized what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first these depredations were only perpetrated at night. The quarry was
      selected during the day, and arrangements made for a descent. After the
      victim was asleep the band dashed down upon him, and sheared him of his
      goods with incredible swiftness. Those near would raise the cry of
      "Raiders!" and attack the robbers. If the latter had secured their booty
      they retreated with all possible speed, and were soon lost in the crowd.
      If not, they would offer battle, and signal for assistance from the other
      bands. Severe engagements of this kind were of continual occurrence, in
      which men were so badly beaten as to die from the effects. The weapons
      used were fists, clubs, axes, tent-poles, etc. The Raiders were
      plentifully provided with the usual weapons of their class--slung-shots
      and brass-knuckles. Several of them had succeeded in smuggling
      bowie-knives into prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had the great advantage in these rows of being well acquainted with
      each other, while, except the Plymouth Pilgrims, the rest of the prisoners
      were made up of small squads of men from each regiment in the service, and
      total strangers to all outside of their own little band. The Raiders could
      concentrate, if necessary, four hundred or five hundred men upon any point
      of attack, and each member of the gangs had become so familiarized with
      all the rest by long association in New York, and elsewhere, that he never
      dealt a blow amiss, while their opponents were nearly as likely to attack
      friends as enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the middle of June the continual success of the Raiders emboldened them
      so that they no longer confined their depredations to the night, but made
      their forays in broad daylight, and there was hardly an hour in the
      twenty-four that the cry of "Raiders! Raiders!" did, not go up from some
      part of the pen, and on looking in the direction of the cry, one would see
      a surging commotion, men struggling, and clubs being plied vigorously.
      This was even more common than the guards shooting men at the Creek
      crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I saw "Dick Allen's Raiders," eleven in number, attack a man
      wearing the uniform of Ellett's Marine Brigade. He was a recent comer, and
      alone, but he was brave. He had come into possession of a spade, by some
      means or another, and he used this with delightful vigor and effect. Two
      or three times he struck one of his assailants so fairly on the head and
      with such good will that I congratulated myself that he had killed him.
      Finally, Dick Allen managed to slip around behind him unnoticed, and
      striking him on the head with a slung-shot, knocked him down, when the
      whole crowd pounced upon him to kill him, but were driven off by others
      rallying to his assistance. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp223"
      id="linkp223"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceeds of these forays enabled the Raiders to wax fat and lusty,
      while others were dying from starvation. They all had good tents,
      constructed of stolen blankets, and their headquarters was a large, roomy
      tent, with a circular top, situated on the street leading to the South
      Gate, and capable of accommodating from seventy-five to one hundred men.
      All the material for this had been wrested away from others. While
      hundreds were dying of scurvy and diarrhea, from the miserable,
      insufficient food, and lack of vegetables, these fellows had flour, fresh
      meat, onions, potatoes, green beans, and other things, the very looks of
      which were a torture to hungry, scorbutic, dysenteric men. They were on
      the best possible terms with the Rebels, whom they fawned upon and
      groveled before, and were in return allowed many favors, in the way of
      trading, going out upon detail, and making purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among their special objects of attack were the small traders in the
      prison. We had quite a number of these whose genius for barter was so
      strong that it took root and flourished even in that unpropitious soil,
      and during the time when new prisoners were constantly coming in with
      money, they managed to accumulate small sums--from ten dollars upward, by
      trading between the guards and the prisoners. In the period immediately
      following a prisoner's entrance he was likely to spend all his money and
      trade off all his possessions for food, trusting to fortune to get him out
      of there when these were gone. Then was when he was profitable to these
      go-betweens, who managed to make him pay handsomely for what he got. The
      Raiders kept watch of these traders, and plundered them whenever occasion
      served. It reminded one of the habits of the fishing eagle, which hovers
      around until some other bird catches a fish, and then takes it away. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      A COMMUNITY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT--FORMATION OF THE REGULATORS--RAIDERS
      ATTACK KEY BUT ARE BLUFFED OFF--ASSAULT OF THE REGULATORS ON THE RAIDERS
      --DESPERATE BATTLE--OVERTHROW OF THE RAIDERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fully appreciate the condition of affairs let it be remembered that we
      were a community of twenty-five thousand boys and young men--none too
      regardful of control at best--and now wholly destitute of government. The
      Rebels never made the slightest attempt to maintain order in the prison.
      Their whole energies were concentrated in preventing our escape. So long
      as we staid inside the Stockade, they cared as little what we did there as
      for the performances of savages in the interior of Africa. I doubt if they
      would have interfered had one-half of us killed and eaten the other half.
      They rather took a delight in such atrocities as came to their notice. It
      was an ocular demonstration of the total depravity of the Yankees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among ourselves there was no one in position to lay down law and enforce
      it. Being all enlisted men we were on a dead level as far as rank was
      concerned--the highest being only Sergeants, whose stripes carried no
      weight of authority. The time of our stay was--it was hoped--too transient
      to make it worth while bothering about organizing any form of government.
      The great bulk of the boys were recent comers, who hoped that in another
      week or so they would be out again. There were no fat salaries to tempt
      any one to take upon himself the duty of ruling the masses, and all were
      left to their own devices, to do good or evil, according to their several
      bents, and as fear of consequences swayed them. Each little squad of men
      was a law unto themselves, and made and enforced their own regulations on
      their own territory. The administration of justice was reduced to its
      simplest terms. If a fellow did wrong he was pounded--if there was anybody
      capable of doing it. If not he went free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The almost unvarying success of the Raiders in--their forays gave the
      general impression that they were invincible--that is, that not enough men
      could be concentrated against them to whip them. Our ill-success in the
      attack we made on them in April helped us to the same belief. If we could
      not beat them then, we could not now, after we had been enfeebled by
      months of starvation and disease. It seemed to us that the Plymouth
      Pilgrims, whose organization was yet very strong, should undertake the
      task; but, as is usually the case in this world, where we think somebody
      else ought to undertake the performance of a disagreeable public duty,
      they did not see it in the light that we wished them to. They established
      guards around their squads, and helped beat off the Raiders when their own
      territory was invaded, but this was all they would do. The rest of us
      formed similar guards. In the southwest corner of the Stockade--where I
      was--we formed ourselves into a company of fifty active boys--mostly
      belonging to my own battalion and to other Illinois regiments--of which I
      was elected Captain. My First Lieutenant was a tall, taciturn, long-armed
      member of the One Hundred and Eleventh Illinois, whom we called "Egypt,"
      as he came from that section of the State. He was wonderfully handy with
      his fists. I think he could knock a fellow down so that he would
      fall-harder, and lie longer than any person I ever saw. We made a tacit
      division of duties: I did the talking, and "Egypt" went through the manual
      labor of knocking our opponents down. In the numerous little encounters in
      which our company was engaged, "Egypt" would stand by my side, silent,
      grim and patient, while I pursued the dialogue with the leader of the
      other crowd. As soon as he thought the conversation had reached the proper
      point, his long left arm stretched out like a flash, and the other fellow
      dropped as if he had suddenly come in range of a mule that was feeling
      well. That unexpected left-hander never failed. It would have made Charles
      Reade's heart leap for joy to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of our company and our watchfulness, the Raiders beat us badly on
      one occasion. Marion Friend, of Company I of our battalion, was one of the
      small traders, and had accumulated forty dollars by his bartering. One
      evening at dusk Delaney's Raiders, about twenty-five strong, took
      advantage of the absence of most of us drawing rations, to make a rush for
      Marion. They knocked him down, cut him across the wrist and neck with a
      razor, and robbed him of his forty dollars. By the time we could rally
      Delaney and his attendant scoundrels were safe from pursuit in the midst
      of their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of things had become unendurable. Sergeant Leroy L. Key, of
      Company M, our battalion, resolved to make an effort to crush the Raiders.
      He was a printer, from Bloomington, Illinois, tall, dark, intelligent and
      strong-willed, and one of the bravest men I ever knew. He was ably
      seconded by "Limber Jim," of the Sixty-Seventh Illinois, whose lithe,
      sinewy form, and striking features reminded one of a young Sioux brave. He
      had all of Key's desperate courage, but not his brains or his talent for
      leadership. Though fearfully reduced in numbers, our battalion had still
      about one hundred well men in it, and these formed the nucleus for Key's
      band of "Regulators," as they were styled. Among them were several who had
      no equals in physical strength and courage in any of the Raider chiefs.
      Our best man was Ned Carrigan, Corporal of Company I, from Chicago--who
      was so confessedly the best man in the whole prison that he was never
      called upon to demonstrate it. He was a big-hearted, genial Irish boy, who
      was never known to get into trouble on his own account, but only used his
      fists when some of his comrades were imposed upon. He had fought in the
      ring, and on one occasion had killed a man with a single blow of his fist,
      in a prize fight near St. Louis. We were all very proud of him, and it was
      as good as an entertainment to us to see the noisiest roughs subside into
      deferential silence as Ned would come among them, like some grand mastiff
      in the midst of a pack of yelping curs. Ned entered into the regulating
      scheme heartily. Other stalwart specimens of physical manhood in our
      battalion were Sergeant Goody, Ned Johnson, Tom Larkin, and others, who,
      while not approaching Carrigan's perfect manhood, were still more than a
      match for the best of the Raiders. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp228"
      id="linkp228"></a>
    </p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Key proceeded with the greatest secrecy in the organization of his forces.
      He accepted none but Western men, and preferred Illinoisans, Iowans,
      Kansans, Indianians and Ohioans. The boys from those States seemed to
      naturally go together, and be moved by the same motives. He informed Wirz
      what he proposed doing, so that any unusual commotion within the prison
      might not be mistaken for an attempt upon the Stockade, and made the
      excuse for opening with the artillery. Wirz, who happened to be in a
      complaisant humor, approved of the design, and allowed him the use of the
      enclosure of the North Gate to confine his prisoners in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Key's efforts at secrecy, information as to his scheme reached
      the Raiders. It was debated at their headquarters, and decided there that
      Key must be killed. Three men were selected to do this work. They called
      on Key, a dusk, on the evening of the 2d of July. In response to their
      inquiries, he came out of the blanket-covered hole on the hillside that he
      called his tent. They told him what they had heard, and asked if it was
      true. He said it was. One of them then drew a knife, and the other two,
      "billies" to attack him. But, anticipating trouble, Key had procured a
      revolver which one of the Pilgrims had brought in in his knapsack and
      drawing this he drove them off, but without firing a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occurrence caused the greatest excitement. To us of the Regulators it
      showed that the Raiders had penetrated our designs, and were prepared for
      them. To the great majority of the prisoners it was the first intimation
      that such a thing was contemplated; the news spread from squad to squad
      with the greatest rapidity, and soon everybody was discussing the chances
      of the movement. For awhile men ceased their interminable discussion of
      escape and exchange--let those over worked words and themes have a rare
      spell of repose--and debated whether the Raiders would whip the
      regulators, or the Regulators conquer the Raiders. The reasons which I
      have previously enumerated, induced a general disbelief in the probability
      of our success. The Raiders were in good health well fed, used to
      operating together, and had the confidence begotten by a long series of
      successes. The Regulators lacked in all these respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Key had originally fixed on the next day for making the attack, or
      whether this affair precipitated the crisis, I know not, but later in the
      evening he sent us all order: to be on our guard all night, and ready for
      action the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was very little sleep anywhere that night. The Rebels learned
      through their spies that something unusual was going on inside, and as
      their only interpretation of anything unusual there was a design upon the
      Stockade, they strengthened the guards, took additional precautions in
      every way, and spent the hours in anxious anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, fearing that the Raiders might attempt to frustrate the scheme by an
      attack in overpowering force on Key's squad, which would be accompanied by
      the assassination of him and Limber Jim, held ourselves in readiness to
      offer any assistance that might be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Raiders, though confident of success, were no less exercised. They
      threw out pickets to all the approaches to their headquarters, and
      provided otherwise against surprise. They had smuggled in some canteens of
      a cheap, vile whisky made from sorghum--and they grew quite hilarious in
      their Big Tent over their potations. Two songs had long ago been accepted
      by us as peculiarly the Raiders' own--as some one in their crowd sang them
      nearly every evening, and we never heard them anywhere else. The first
      began:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In Athol lived a man named Jerry Lanagan;
        </p>
        <p>
          He battered away till he hadn't a pound.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father he died, and he made him a man agin;
        </p>
        <p>
          Left him a farm of ten acres of ground.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The other related the exploits of an Irish highwayman named Brennan, whose
      chief virtue was that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          What he rob-bed from the rich he gave unto the poor.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And this was the villainous chorus in which they all joined, and sang in
      such a way as suggested highway robbery, murder, mayhem and arson:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Brennan on the moor!
        </p>
        <p>
          Brennan on the moor!
        </p>
        <p>
          Proud and undaunted stood
        </p>
        <p>
          John Brennan on the moor.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      They howled these two yearly the live-long night. They became eventually
      quite monotonous to us, who were waiting and watching. It would have been
      quite a relief if they had thrown in a new one every hour or so, by way of
      variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning at last came. Our companies mustered on their grounds, and then
      marched to the space on the South Side where the rations were issued. Each
      man was armed with a small club, secured to his wrist by a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebels--with their chronic fear of an outbreak animating them--had all
      the infantry in line of battle with loaded guns. The cannon in the works
      were shotted, the fuses thrust into the touch-holes and the men stood with
      lanyards in hand ready to mow down everybody, at any instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose rapidly through the clear sky, which soon glowed down on us
      like a brazen oven. The whole camp gathered where it could best view the
      encounter. This was upon the North Side. As I have before explained the
      two sides sloped toward each other like those of a great trough. The
      Raiders' headquarters stood upon the center of the southern slope, and
      consequently those standing on the northern slope saw everything as if
      upon the stage of a theater.

      While standing in ranks waiting the orders to move, one of my comrades
      touched me on the arm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! just look over there!" <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp231"
      id="linkp231"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned from watching the Rebel artillerists, whose intentions gave me
      more uneasiness than anything else, and looked in the direction indicated
      by the speaker. The sight was the strangest one my eyes ever encountered.
      There were at least fifteen thousand perhaps twenty thousand--men packed
      together on the bank, and every eye was turned on us. The slope was such
      that each man's face showed over the shoulders of the one in front of him,
      making acres on acres of faces. It was as if the whole broad hillside was
      paved or thatched with human countenances.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready we moved down upon the Big Tent, in as good order as we
      could preserve while passing through the narrow tortuous paths between the
      tents. Key, Limber Jim, Ned Carigan, Goody, Tom Larkin, and Ned Johnson
      led the advance with their companies. The prison was as silent as a
      graveyard. As we approached, the Raiders massed themselves in a strong,
      heavy line, with the center, against which our advance was moving, held by
      the most redoubtable of their leaders. How many there were of them could
      not be told, as it was impossible to say where their line ended and the
      mass of spectators began. They could not themselves tell, as the attitude
      of a large portion of the spectators would be determined by which way the
      battle went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a blow was struck until the lines came close together. Then the Raider
      center launched itself forward against ours, and grappled savagely with
      the leading Regulators. For an instant--it seemed an hour--the struggle
      was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong, fierce men clenched and strove to throttle each other; great
      muscles strained almost to bursting, and blows with fist and club-dealt
      with all the energy of mortal hate--fell like hail. One--perhaps two
      endless minutes the lines surged--throbbed--backward and forward a step or
      two, and then, as if by a concentration of mighty effort, our men flung
      the Raider line back from it--broken--shattered. The next instant our
      leaders were striding through the mass like raging lions. Carrigan, Limber
      Jim, Larkin, Johnson and Goody each smote down a swath of men before them,
      as they moved resistlessly forward. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp232"
      id="linkp232"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p232.jpg (43K)" src="images/p232.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We light weights had been sent around on the flanks to separate the
      spectators from the combatants, strike the Raiders 'en revers,' and, as
      far as possible, keep the crowd from reinforcing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes after the first blow--was struck the overthrow of the
      Raiders was complete. Resistance ceased, and they sought safety in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the result became apparent to the--watchers on the opposite hillside,
      they vented their pent-up excitement in a yell that made the very ground
      tremble, and we answered them with a shout that expressed not only our
      exultation over our victory, but our great relief from the intense strain
      we had long borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      We picked up a few prisoners on the battle field, and retired without
      making any special effort to get any more then, as we knew, that they
      could not escape us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were very tired, and very hungry. The time for drawing rations had
      arrived. Wagons containing bread and mush had driven to the gates, but
      Wirz would not allow these to be opened, lest in the excited condition of
      the men an attempt might be made to carry them. Key ordered operations to
      cease, that Wirz might be re-assured and let the rations enter. It was in
      vain. Wirz was thoroughly scared. The wagons stood out in the hot sun
      until the mush fermented and soured, and had to be thrown away, while we
      event rationless to bed, and rose the next day with more than usually
      empty stomachs to goad us on to our work. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      WHY THE REGULATORS WERE NOT ASSISTED BY THE ENTIRE CAMP--PECULIARITIES OF
      BOYS FROM DIFFERENT SECTIONS--HUNTING THE RAIDERS DOWN--EXPLOITS OF MY
      LEFT-HANDED LIEUTENANT--RUNNING THE GAUNTLET.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may not have made it wholly clear to the reader why we did not have the
      active assistance of the whole prison in the struggle with the Raiders.
      There were many reasons for this. First, the great bulk of the prisoners
      were new comers, having been, at the farthest, but three or four weeks in
      the Stockade. They did not comprehend the situation of affairs as we older
      prisoners did. They did not understand that all the outrages--or very
      nearly all--were the work of--a relatively small crowd of graduates from
      the metropolitan school of vice. The activity and audacity of the Raiders
      gave them the impression that at least half the able-bodied men in the
      Stockade were engaged in these depredations. This is always the case. A
      half dozen burglars or other active criminals in a town will produce the
      impression that a large portion of the population are law breakers. We
      never estimated that the raiding N'Yaarkers, with their spies and other
      accomplices, exceeded five hundred, but it would have been difficult to
      convince a new prisoner that there were not thousands of them. Secondly,
      the prisoners were made up of small squads from every regiment at the
      front along the whole line from the Mississippi to the Atlantic. These
      were strangers to and distrustful of all out side their own little
      circles. The Eastern men were especially so. The Pennsylvanians and New
      Yorkers each formed groups, and did not fraternize readily with those
      outside their State lines. The New Jerseyans held aloof from all the rest,
      while the Massachusetts soldiers had very little in Common with
      anybody--even their fellow New Englanders. The Michigan men were modified
      New Englanders. They had the same tricks of speech; they said "I be" for
      "I am," and "haag" for "hog;" "Let me look at your knife half a second,"
      or "Give me just a sup of that water," where we said simply "Lend me your
      knife," or "hand me a drink." They were less reserved than the true
      Yankees, more disposed to be social, and, with all their eccentricities,
      were as manly, honorable a set of fellows as it was my fortune to meet
      with in the army. I could ask no better comrades than the boys of the
      Third Michigan Infantry, who belonged to the same "Ninety" with me. The
      boys from Minnesota and Wisconsin were very much like those from Michigan.
      Those from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Kansas all seemed cut off the
      same piece. To all intents and purposes they might have come from the same
      County. They spoke the same dialect, read the same newspapers, had studied
      McGuffey's Readers, Mitchell's Geography, and Ray's Arithmetics at school,
      admired the same great men, and held generally the same opinions on any
      given subject. It was never difficult to get them to act in unison--they
      did it spontaneously; while it required an effort to bring about harmony
      of action with those from other sections. Had the Western boys in prison
      been thoroughly advised of the nature of our enterprise, we could,
      doubtless, have commanded their cordial assistance, but they were not, and
      there was no way in which it could be done readily, until after the
      decisive blow was struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of arresting the leading Raiders went on actively all day on the
      Fourth of July. They made occasional shows of fierce resistance, but the
      events of the day before had destroyed their prestige, broken their
      confidence, and driven away from their support very many who followed
      their lead when they were considered all-powerful. They scattered from
      their former haunts, and mingled with the crowds in other parts of the
      prison, but were recognized, and reported to Key, who sent parties to
      arrest them. Several times they managed to collect enough adherents to
      drive off the squads sent after them, but this only gave them a short
      respite, for the squad would return reinforced, and make short work of
      them. Besides, the prisoners generally were beginning to understand and
      approve of the Regulators' movement, and were disposed to give all the
      assistance needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself and "Egypt," my taciturn Lieutenant of the sinewy left arm, were
      sent with our company to arrest Pete Donnelly, a notorious character, and
      leader of, a bad crowd. He was more "knocker" than Raider, however. He was
      an old Pemberton building acquaintance, and as we marched up to where he
      was standing at the head of his gathering clan, he recognized me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Illinoy," (the name by which I was generally known in prison)
      "what do you want here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, "Pete, Key has sent me for you. I want you to go to
      headquarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the ---- does Key want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I'm sure; he only said to bring you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I haven't had anything to do with them other snoozers you have been
      a-having trouble with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything about that; you can talk to Key as to that. I only
      know that we are sent for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you don't think you can take me unless I choose to go? You haint
      got anybody in that crowd big enough to make it worth while for him to
      waste his time trying it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied diffidently that one never knew what--he could do till he tried;
      that while none of us were very big, we were as willing a lot of little
      fellows as he ever saw, and if it were all the same to him, we would
      undertake to waste a little time getting him to headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation seemed unnecessarily long to "Egypt," who stood by my
      side; about a half step in advance. Pete was becoming angrier and more
      defiant every minute. His followers were crowding up to us, club in hand.
      Finally Pete thrust his fist in my face, and roared out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "By ---, I ain't a going with ye, and ye can't take me, you ---- ---- ----
      "
    </p>
    <p>
      This was "Egypt's" cue. His long left arm uncoupled like the loosening of
      the weight of a pile-driver. It caught Mr. Donnelly under the chin, fairly
      lifted him from his feet, and dropped him on his back among his followers.
      It seemed to me that the predominating expression in his face as he went,
      over was that of profound wonder as to where that blow could have come
      from, and why he did not see it in time to dodge or ward it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Pete dropped, the rest of us stepped forward with our clubs, to engage
      his followers, while "Egypt" and one or two others tied his hands and
      otherwise secured him. But his henchmen made no effort to rescue him, and
      we carried him over to headquarters without molestation. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      The work of arresting increased in interest and excitement until it
      developed into the furore of a hunt, with thousands eagerly engaged in it.
      The Raiders' tents were torn down and pillaged. Blankets, tent poles, and
      cooking utensils were carried off as spoils, and the ground was dug over
      for secreted property. A large quantity of watches, chains, knives, rings,
      gold pens, etc., etc.--the booty of many a raid--was found, and helped to
      give impetus to the hunt. Even the Rebel Quartermaster, with the
      characteristic keen scent of the Rebels for spoils, smelled from the
      outside the opportunity for gaining plunder, and came in with a squad of
      Rebels equipped with spades, to dig for buried treasures. How successful
      he was I know not, as I took no part in any of the operations of that
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was claimed that several skeletons of victims of the Raiders were found
      buried beneath the tent. I cannot speak with any certainty as to this,
      though my impression is that at least one was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      By evening Key had perhaps one hundred and twenty-five of the most noted
      Raiders in his hands. Wirz had allowed him the use of the small stockade
      forming the entrance to the North Gate to confine them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was the judgment and punishment of the arrested ones. For
      this purpose Key organized a court martial composed of thirteen Sergeants,
      chosen from the latest arrivals of prisoners, that they might have no
      prejudice against the Raiders. I believe that a man named Dick McCullough,
      belonging to the Third Missouri Cavalry, was the President of the Court.
      The trial was carefully conducted, with all the formality of a legal
      procedure that the Court and those managing the matter could remember as
      applicable to the crimes with which the accused were charged. Each of
      these confronted by the witnesses who testified against him, and allowed
      to cross-examine them to any extent he desired. The defense was managed by
      one of their crowd, the foul-tongued Tombs shyster, Pete Bradley, of whom
      I have before spoken. Such was the fear of the vengeance of the Raiders
      and their friends that many who had been badly abused dared not testify
      against them, dreading midnight assassination if they did. Others would
      not go before the Court except at night. But for all this there was no
      lack of evidence; there were thousands who had been robbed and maltreated,
      or who had seen these outrages committed on others, and the boldness of
      the leaders in their bight of power rendered their identification a matter
      of no difficulty whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial lasted several days, and concluded with sentencing quite a large
      number to run the gauntlet, a smaller number to wear balls and chains, and
      the following six to be hanged:
    </p>
    <p>
      John Sarsfield, One Hundred and Forty-Fourth New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Collins, alias "Mosby," Company D, Eighty-Eighth Pennsylvania,
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Curtis, Company A, Fifth Rhode Island Artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick Delaney, Company E, Eighty-Third Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Muir, United States Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence Sullivan, Seventy-Second New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      These names and regiments are of little consequence, however, as I believe
      all the rascals were professional bounty-jumpers, and did not belong to
      any regiment longer than they could find an opportunity to desert and join
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those sentenced to ball-and-chain were brought in immediately, and had the
      irons fitted to them that had been worn by some of our men as a punishment
      for trying to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet determined how punishment should be meted out to the
      remainder, but circumstances themselves decided the matter. Wirz became
      tired of guarding so large a number as Key had arrested, and he informed
      Key that he should turn them back into the Stockade immediately. Key
      begged for little farther time to consider the disposition of the cases,
      but Wirz refused it, and ordered the Officer of the Guard to return all
      arrested, save those sentenced to death, to the Stockade. In the meantime
      the news had spread through the prison that the Raiders were to be sent in
      again unpunished, and an angry mob, numbering some thousands, and mostly
      composed of men who had suffered injuries at the hands of the marauders,
      gathered at the South Gate, clubs in hand, to get such satisfaction as
      they could out of the rascals. They formed in two long, parallel lines,
      facing inward, and grimly awaited the incoming of the objects of their
      vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Officer of the Guard opened the wicket in the gate, and began forcing
      the Raiders through it--one at a time--at the point of the bayonet, and
      each as he entered was told what he already realized well--that he must
      run for his life. They did this with all the energy that they possessed,
      and as they ran blows rained on their heads, arms and backs. If they could
      succeed in breaking through the line at any place they were generally let
      go without any further punishment. Three of the number were beaten to
      death. I saw one of these killed. I had no liking for the gauntlet
      performance, and refused to have anything to do with it, as did most, if
      not all, of my crowd. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp240" id="linkp240"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p240.jpg (24K)" src="images/p240.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      While the gauntlet was in operation, I was standing by my tent at the head
      of a little street, about two hundred feet from the line, watching what
      was being done. A sailor was let in. He had a large bowie knife concealed
      about his person somewhere, which he drew, and struck savagely with at his
      tormentors on either side. They fell back from before him, but closed in
      behind and pounded him terribly. He broke through the line, and ran up the
      street towards me. About midway of the distance stood a boy who had helped
      carry a dead man out during the day, and while out had secured a large
      pine rail which he had brought in with him. He was holding this straight
      up in the air, as if at a "present arms." He seemed to have known from the
      first that the Raider would run that way. Just as he came squarely under
      it, the boy dropped the rail like the bar of a toll gate. It struck the
      Raider across the head, felled him as if by a shot, and his pursuers then
      beat him to death. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      It began to be pretty generally understood through the prison that six men
      had been sentenced to be hanged, though no authoritative announcement of
      the fact had been made. There was much canvassing as to where they should
      be executed, and whether an attempt to hang them inside of the Stockade
      would not rouse their friends to make a desperate effort to rescue them,
      which would precipitate a general engagement of even larger proportions
      than that of the 3d. Despite the result of the affairs of that and the
      succeeding days, the camp was not yet convinced that the Raiders were
      really conquered, and the Regulators themselves were not thoroughly at
      ease on that score. Some five thousand or six thousand new prisoners had
      come in since the first of the month, and it was claimed that the Raiders
      had received large reinforcements from those,--a claim rendered probable
      by most of the new-comers being from the Army of the Potomac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key and those immediately about him kept their own counsel in the matter,
      and suffered no secret of their intentions to leak out, until on the
      morning of the 11th, when it became generally known that the sentences
      were too be carried into effect that day, and inside the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first direct information as to this was by a messenger from Key with an
      order to assemble my company and stand guard over the carpenters who were
      to erect the scaffold. He informed me that all the Regulators would be
      held in readiness to come to our relief if we were attacked in force. I
      had hoped that if the men were to be hanged I would be spared the
      unpleasant duty of assisting, for, though I believed they richly deserved
      that punishment, I had much rather some one else administered it upon
      them. There was no way out of it, however, that I could see, and so
      "Egypt" and I got the boys together, and marched down to the designated
      place, which was an open space near the end of the street running from the
      South Gate, and kept vacant for the purpose of issuing rations. It was
      quite near the spot where the Raiders' Big Tent had stood, and afforded as
      good a view to the rest of the camp as could be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key had secured the loan of a few beams and rough planks, sufficient to
      build a rude scaffold with. Our first duty was to care for these as they
      came in, for such was the need of wood, and plank for tent purposes, that
      they would scarcely have fallen to the ground before they were spirited
      away, had we not stood over them all the time with clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carpenters sent by Key came over and set to work. The N'Yaarkers
      gathered around in considerable numbers, sullen and abusive. They cursed
      us with all their rich vocabulary of foul epithets, vowed that we should
      never carry out the execution, and swore that they had marked each one for
      vengeance. We returned the compliments in kind, and occasionally it seemed
      as if a general collision was imminent; but we succeeded in avoiding this,
      and by noon the scaffold was finished. It was a very simple affair. A
      stout beam was fastened on the top of two posts, about fifteen feet high.
      At about the height of a man's head a couple of boards stretched across
      the space between the posts, and met in the center. The ends at the posts
      laid on cleats; the ends in the center rested upon a couple of boards,
      standing upright, and each having a piece of rope fastened through a hole
      in it in such a manner, that a man could snatch it from under the planks
      serving as the floor of the scaffold, and let the whole thing drop. A rude
      ladder to ascend by completed the preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the arrangements neared completion the excitement in and around the
      prison grew intense. Key came over with the balance of the Regulators, and
      we formed a hollow square around the scaffold, our company marking the
      line on the East Side. There were now thirty thousand in the prison. Of
      these about one-third packed themselves as tightly about our square as
      they could stand. The remaining twenty thousand were wedged together in a
      solid mass on the North Side. Again I contemplated the wonderful,
      startling, spectacle of a mosaic pavement of human faces covering the
      whole broad hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the Rebel, infantry was standing in the rifle pits, the
      artillerymen were in place about their loaded and trained pieces, the No.
      4 of each gun holding the lanyard cord in his hand, ready to fire the
      piece at the instant of command. The small squad of cavalry was drawn up
      on the hill near the Star Fort, and near it were the masters of the
      hounds, with their yelping packs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the hangers-on of the Rebel camp--clerks, teamsters, employer, negros,
      hundreds of white and colored women, in all forming a motley crowd of
      between one and two thousand, were gathered together in a group between
      the end of the rifle pits and the Star Fort. They had a good view from
      there, but a still better one could be had, a little farther to the right,
      and in front of the guns. They kept edging up in that direction, as crowds
      will, though they knew the danger they would incur if the artillery
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was broiling hot. The sun shot his perpendicular rays down with
      blistering fierceness, and the densely packed, motionless crowds made the
      heat almost insupportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key took up his position inside the square to direct matters. With him
      were Limber Jim, Dick McCullough, and one or two others. Also, Ned
      Johnson, Tom Larkin, Sergeant Goody, and three others who were to act as
      hangmen. Each of these six was provided with a white sack, such as the
      Rebels brought in meal in. Two Corporals of my company--"Stag" Harris and
      Wat Payne--were appointed to pull the stays from under the platform at the
      signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after noon the South Gate opened, and Wirz rode in, dressed in a
      suit of white duck, and mounted on his white horse--a conjunction which
      had gained for him the appellation of "Death on a Pale Horse." Behind him
      walked the faithful old priest, wearing his Church's purple insignia of
      the deepest sorrow, and reading the service for the condemned. The six
      doomed men followed, walking between double ranks of Rebel guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      All came inside the hollow square and halted. Wirz then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brizners, I return to you dose men so Boot as I got dem. You haf tried
      dem yourselves, and found dem guilty--I haf had notting to do wit it. I
      vash my hands of eferyting connected wit dem. Do wit dem as you like, and
      may Gott haf mercy on you and on dem. Garts, about face! Voryvarts,
      march!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he marched out and left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the condemned looked stunned. They seemed to comprehend for
      the first time that it was really the determination of the Regulators to
      hang them. Before that they had evidently thought that the talk of hanging
      was merely bluff. One of them gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, men, you don't really mean to hang us up there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Key answered grimly and laconically:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That seems to be about the size of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this they burst out in a passionate storm of intercessions and
      imprecations, which lasted for a minute or so, when it was stopped by one
      of them saying imperatively:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All of you stop now, and let the priest talk for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the priest closed the book upon which he had kept his eyes bent
      since his entrance, and facing the multitude on the North Side began a
      plea for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condemned faced in the same direction to read their fate in the
      countenances of those whom he was addressing. This movement brought
      Curtis--a low-statured, massively built man--on the right of their line,
      and about ten or fifteen steps from my company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole camp had been as still as death since Wirz's exit. The silence
      seemed to become even more profound as the priest began his appeal. For a
      minute every ear was strained to catch what he said. Then, as the nearest
      of the thousands comprehended what he was saying they raised a shout of
      "No! no!! NO!!" "Hang them! hang them!" "Don't let them go! Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang the rascals! hang the villains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang,'em! hang 'em! hang 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was taken up all over the prison, and tens of thousands throats
      yelled it in a fearful chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curtis turned from the crowd with desperation convulsing his features.
      Tearing off the broad-brimmed hat which he wore, he flung it on the ground
      with the exclamation!
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, I'll die this way first!" and, drawing his head down and folding
      his arms about it, he dashed forward for the center of my company, like a
      great stone hurled from a catapult.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egypt" and I saw where he was going to strike, and ran down the line to
      help stop him. As he came up we rained blows on his head with our clubs,
      but so many of us struck at him at once that we broke each other's clubs
      to pieces, and only knocked him on his knees. He rose with an almost
      superhuman effort, and plunged into the mass beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement almost became delirium. For an instant I feared that
      everything was gone to ruin. "Egypt" and I strained every energy to
      restore our lines, before the break could be taken advantage of by the
      others. Our boys behaved splendidly, standing firm, and in a few seconds
      the line was restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Curtis broke through, Delaney, a brawny Irishman standing next to him,
      started to follow. He took one step. At the same instant Limber Jim's long
      legs took three great strides, and placed him directly in front of
      Delaney. Jim's right hand held an enormous bowie-knife, and as he raised
      it above Delaney he hissed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you dare move another step, I'll open you ---- ---- ----, I'll open
      you from one end to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delaney stopped. This checked the others till our lines reformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Wirz saw the commotion he was panic-stricken with fear that the
      long-dreaded assault on the Stockade had begun. He ran down from the
      headquarter steps to the Captain of the battery, shrieking:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire! fire! fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, not being a fool, could see that the rush was not towards the
      Stockade, but away from it, and he refrained from giving the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spectators who had gotten before the guns, heard Wirz's excited
      yell, and remembering the consequences to themselves should the artillery
      be discharged, became frenzied with fear, and screamed, and fell down over
      and trampled upon each other in endeavoring to get away. The guards on
      that side of the Stockade ran down in a panic, and the ten thousand
      prisoners immediately around us, expecting no less than that the next
      instant we would be swept with grape and canister, stampeded tumultuously.
      There were quite a number of wells right around us, and all of these were
      filled full of men that fell into them as the crowd rushed away. Many had
      legs and arms broken, and I have no doubt that several were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the stormiest five minutes that I ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going on two of my company, belonging to the Fifth Iowa
      Cavalry, were in hot pursuit of Curtis. I had seen them start and shouted
      to them to come back, as I feared they would be set upon by the Raiders
      and murdered. But the din was so overpowering that they could not hear me,
      and doubtless would not have come back if they had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curtis ran diagonally down the hill, jumping over the tents and knocking
      down the men who happened in his way. Arriving at the swamp he plunged in,
      sinking nearly to his hips in the fetid, filthy ooze. He forged his way
      through with terrible effort. His pursuers followed his example, and
      caught up to him just as he emerged on the other side. They struck him on
      the back of the head with their clubs, and knocked him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time order had been restored about us. The guns remained silent,
      and the crowd massed around us again. From where we were we could see the
      successful end of the chase after Curtis, and could see his captors start
      back with him. Their success was announced with a roar of applause from
      the North Side. Both captors and captured were greatly exhausted, and they
      were coming back very slowly. Key ordered the balance up on to the
      scaffold. They obeyed promptly. The priest resumed his reading of the
      service for the condemned. The excitement seemed to make the doomed ones
      exceedingly thirsty. I never saw men drink such inordinate quantities of
      water. They called for it continually, gulped down a quart or more at a
      time, and kept two men going nearly all the time carrying it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Curtis finally arrived, he sat on the ground for a minute or so, to
      rest, and then, reeking with filth, slowly and painfully climbed the
      steps. Delaney seemed to think he was suffering as much from fright as
      anything else, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on up, now, show yourself a man, and die game." <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a name="linkp245" id="linkp245"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p245.jpg (116K)" src="images/p245.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the priest resumed his reading, but it had no interest to Delaney,
      who kept calling out directions to Pete Donelly, who was standing in the
      crowd, as to dispositions to be made of certain bits of stolen property:
      to give a watch to this one, a ring to another, and so on. Once the priest
      stopped and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, let the things of this earth go, and turn your attention toward
      those of heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Delaney paid no attention to this admonition. The whole six then began
      delivering farewell messages to those in the crowd. Key pulled a watch
      from his pocket and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two minutes more to talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Delaney said cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, good by, b'ys; if I've hurted any of y ez, I hope ye'll forgive me.
      Shpake up, now, any of yez that I've hurted, and say yell forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      We called upon Marion Friend, whose throat Delaney had tried to cut three
      weeks before while robbing him of forty dollars, to come forward, but
      Friend was not in a forgiving mood, and refused with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time's up!" put the watch back in his pocket and raised his hand like an
      officer commanding a gun. Harris and Payne laid hold of the ropes to the
      supports of the planks. Each of the six hangmen tied a condemned man's
      hands, pulled a meal sack down over his head, placed the noose around his
      neck, drew it up tolerably close, and sprang to the ground. The priest
      began praying aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key dropped his hand. Payne and Harris snatched the supports out with a
      single jerk. The planks fell with a clatter. Five of the bodies swung
      around dizzily in the air. The sixth that of "Mosby," a large, powerful,
      raw-boned man, one of the worst in the lot, and who, among other crimes,
      had killed Limber Jim's brother-broke the rope, and fell with a thud to
      the ground. Some of the men ran forward, examined the body, and decided
      that he still lived. The rope was cut off his neck, the meal sack removed,
      and water thrown in his face until consciousness returned. At the first
      instant he thought he was in eternity. He gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where am I? Am I in the other world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Limber Jim muttered that they would soon show him where he was, and went
      on grimly fixing up the scaffold anew. "Mosby" soon realized what had
      happened, and the unrelenting purpose of the Regulator Chiefs. Then he
      began to beg piteously for his life, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O for God's sake, do not put me up there again! God has spared my life
      once. He meant that you should be merciful to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Limber Jim deigned him no reply. When the scaffold was rearranged, and a
      stout rope had replaced the broken one, he pulled the meal sack once more
      over "Mosby's" head, who never ceased his pleadings. Then picking up the
      large man as if he were a baby, he carried him to the scaffold and handed
      him up to Tom Larkin, who fitted the noose around his neck and sprang
      down. The supports had not been set with the same delicacy as at first,
      and Limber Jim had to set his heel and wrench desperately at them before
      he could force them out. Then "Mosby" passed away without a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hanging till life was extinct, the bodies were cut down, the
      meal-sacks pulled off their faces, and the Regulators formal two parallel
      lines, through which all the prisoners passed and took a look at the
      bodies. Pete Donnelly and Dick Allen knelt down and wiped the froth off
      Delaney's lips, and swore vengeance against those who had done him to
      death. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <h2>
      <a name="linkch38" id="linkch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      AFTER THE EXECUTION--FORMATION OF A POLICE FORCE--ITS FIRST CHIEF
      --"SPANKING" AN OFFENDER.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the executions Key, knowing that he, and all those prominently
      connected with the hanging, would be in hourly danger of assassination if
      they remained inside, secured details as nurses and ward-masters in the
      hospital, and went outside. In this crowd were Key, Ned Carrigan, Limber
      Jim, Dick McCullough, the six hangmen, the two Corporals who pulled the
      props from under the scaffold, and perhaps some others whom I do not now
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile provision had been made for the future maintenance of
      order in the prison by the organization of a regular police force, which
      in time came to number twelve hundred men. These were divided into
      companies, under appropriate officers. Guards were detailed for certain
      locations, patrols passed through the camp in all directions continually,
      and signals with whistles could summon sufficient assistance to suppress
      any disturbance, or carry out any orders from the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chieftainship was first held by Key, but when he went outside he
      appointed Sergeant A. R. Hill, of the One Hundredth O. V. I.--now a
      resident of Wauseon, Ohio,--his successor. Hill was one of the
      notabilities of that immense throng. A great, broad-shouldered, giant, in
      the prime of his manhood--the beginning of his thirtieth year--he was as
      good-natured as big, and as mild-mannered as brave. He spoke slowly,
      softly, and with a slightly rustic twang, that was very tempting to a
      certain class of sharps to take him up for a "luberly greeny." The man who
      did so usually repented his error in sack-cloth and ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hill first came into prominence as the victor in the most stubbornly
      contested fight in the prison history of Belle Isle. When the squad of the
      One Hundredth Ohio--captured at Limestone Station, East Tennessee, in
      September,1863--arrived on Belle Isle, a certain Jack Oliver, of the
      Nineteenth Indiana, was the undisputed fistic monarch of the Island. He
      did not bear his blushing honors modestly; few of a right arm that
      indefinite locality known as "the middle of next week," is something that
      the possessor can as little resist showing as can a girl her first
      solitaire ring. To know that one can certainly strike a disagreeable
      fellow out of time is pretty sure to breed a desire to do that thing
      whenever occasion serves. Jack Oliver was one who did not let his biceps
      rust in inaction, but thrashed everybody on the Island whom he thought
      needed it, and his ideas as to those who should be included in this class
      widened daily, until it began to appear that he would soon feel it his
      duty to let no unwhipped man escape, but pound everybody on the Island.
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp253" id="linkp253"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One day his evil genius led him to abuse a rather elderly man belonging to
      Hill's mess. As he fired off his tirade of contumely, Hill said with more
      than his usual "soft" rusticity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mister--I--don't--think--it--just--right--for--a--young--man--to--call--an--old--one--such--bad
      names."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Oliver turned on him savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! may be you want to take it up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The grin on Hill's face looked still more verdant, as he answered with
      gentle deliberation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--mister--I--don't--go--around--a--hunting--things--but--I
      --ginerally--take--care--of--all--that's--sent--me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack foamed, but his fiercest bluster could not drive that infantile smile
      from Hill's face, nor provoke a change in the calm slowness of his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that nothing would do but a battle-royal, and Jack had
      sense enough to see that the imperturbable rustic was likely to give him a
      job of some difficulty. He went off and came back with his clan, while
      Hill's comrades of the One Hundredth gathered around to insure him fair
      play. Jack pulled off his coat and vest, rolled up his sleeves, and made
      other elaborate preparations for the affray. Hill, without removing a
      garment, said, as he surveyed him with a mocking smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mister--you--seem--to--be--one--of--them--partick-e-ler--fellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack roared out,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By ---, I'll make you partickeler before I get through with you. Now, how
      shall we settle this? Regular stand-up-and knock-down, or rough and
      tumble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything Hill's face was more vacantly serene, and his tones blander
      than ever, as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strike--any--gait--that--suits--you,--Mister;--I guess--I--will--be
      --able--to--keep--up--with--you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They closed. Hill feinted with his left, and as Jack uncovered to guard,
      he caught him fairly on the lower left ribs, by a blow from his mighty
      right fist, that sounded--as one of the by-standers expressed it--"like
      striking a hollow log with a maul."
    </p>
    <p>
      The color in Jack's face paled. He did not seem to understand how he had
      laid himself open to such a pass, and made the same mistake, receiving
      again a sounding blow in the short ribs. This taught him nothing, either,
      for again he opened his guard in response to a feint, and again caught a
      blow on his luckless left, ribs, that drove the blood from his face and
      the breath from his body. He reeled back among his supporters for an
      instant to breathe. Recovering his wind, be dashed at Hill feinted
      strongly with his right, but delivered a terrible kick against the lower
      part of the latter's abdomen. Both closed and fought savagely at
      half-arm's length for an instant; during which Hill struck Jack so fairly
      in the mouth as to break out three front teeth, which the latter
      swallowed. Then they clenched and struggled to throw each other. Hill's
      superior strength and skill crushed his opponent to the ground, and he
      fell upon him. As they grappled there, one of Jack's followers sought to
      aid his leader by catching Hill by the hair, intending to kick him in the
      face. In an instant he was knocked down by a stalwart member of the One
      Hundredth, and then literally lifted out of the ring by kicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack was soon so badly beaten as to be unable to cry "enough!" One of his
      friends did that service for him, the fight ceased, and thenceforth Mr.
      Oliver resigned his pugilistic crown, and retired to the shades of private
      life. He died of scurvy and diarrhea, some months afterward, in
      Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The almost hourly scenes of violence and crime that marked the days and
      nights before the Regulators began operations were now succeeded by the
      greatest order. The prison was freer from crime than the best governed
      City. There were frequent squabbles and fights, of course, and many petty
      larcenies. Rations of bread and of wood, articles of clothing, and the
      wretched little cans and half canteens that formed our cooking utensils,
      were still stolen, but all these were in a sneak-thief way. There was an
      entire absence of the audacious open-day robbery and murder --the
      "raiding" of the previous few weeks. The summary punishment inflicted on
      the condemned was sufficient to cow even bolder men than the Raiders, and
      they were frightened into at least quiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Hill's administration was vigorous, and secured the best results.
      He became a judge of all infractions of morals and law, and sat at the
      door of his tent to dispense justice to all comers, like the Cadi of a
      Mahometan Village. His judicial methods and punishments also reminded one
      strongly of the primitive judicature of Oriental lands. The wronged one
      came before him and told his tale: he had his blouse, or his quart cup, or
      his shoes, or his watch, or his money stolen during the night. The
      suspected one was also summoned, confronted with his accuser, and sharply
      interrogated. Hill would revolve the stories in his mind, decide the
      innocence or guilt of the accused, and if he thought the accusation
      sustained, order the culprit to punishment. He did not imitate his
      Mussulman prototypes to the extent of bowstringing or decapitating the
      condemned, nor did he cut any thief's hands off, nor yet nail his ears to
      a doorpost, but he introduced a modification of the bastinado that made
      those who were punished by it even wish they were dead. The instrument
      used was what is called in the South a "shake" --a split shingle, a yard
      or more long, and with one end whittled down to form a handle. The culprit
      was made to bend down until he could catch around his ankles with his
      hands. The part of the body thus brought into most prominence was denuded
      of clothing and "spanked" from one to twenty times, as Hill ordered, by
      the "shake" in same strong and willing hand. It was very amusing--to the
      bystanders. The "spankee" never seemed to enter very heartily into the
      mirth of the occasion. As a rule he slept on his face for a week or so
      after, and took his meals standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear of the spanking, and Hill's skill in detecting the guilty ones,
      had a very salutary effect upon the smaller criminals. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      The Raiders who had been put into irons were very restive under the
      infliction, and begged Hill daily to release them. They professed the
      greatest penitence, and promised the most exemplary behavior for the
      future. Hill refused to release them, declaring that they should wear the
      irons until delivered up to our Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Raiders--named Heffron--had, shortly after his arrest, turned
      State's evidence, and given testimony that assisted materially in the
      conviction of his companions. One morning, a week or so after the hanging,
      his body was found lying among the other dead at the South Gate. The
      impression made by the fingers of the hand that had strangled him, were
      still plainly visible about the throat. There was no doubt as to why he
      had been killed, or that the Raiders were his murderers, but the actual
      perpetrators were never discovered. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      JULY--THE PRISON BECOMES MORE CROWDED, THE WEATHER HOTTER, NATIONS POORER,
      AND MORTALITY GREATER--SOME OF THE PHENOMENA OF SUFFERING AND DEATH.
    </p>
    <p>
      All during July the prisoners came streaming in by hundreds and thousands
      from every portion of the long line of battle, stretching from the Eastern
      bank of the Mississippi to the shores of the Atlantic. Over one thousand
      squandered by Sturgis at Guntown came in; two thousand of those captured
      in the desperate blow dealt by Hood against the Army of the Tennessee on
      the 22d of the month before Atlanta; hundreds from Hunter's luckless
      column in the Shenandoah Valley, thousands from Grant's lines in front of
      Petersburg. In all, seven thousand one hundred and twenty-eight were,
      during the month, turned into that seething mass of corrupting humanity to
      be polluted and tainted by it, and to assist in turn to make it fouler and
      deadlier. Over seventy hecatombs of chosen victims --of fair youths in the
      first flush of hopeful manhood, at the threshold of a life of honor to
      themselves and of usefulness to the community; beardless boys, rich in the
      priceless affections of homes, fathers, mothers, sisters and sweethearts,
      with minds thrilling with high aspirations for the bright future, were
      sent in as the monthly sacrifice to this Minotaur of the Rebellion, who,
      couched in his foul lair, slew them, not with the merciful delivery of
      speedy death, as his Cretan prototype did the annual tribute of Athenian
      youths and maidens, but, gloating over his prey, doomed them to lingering
      destruction. He rotted their flesh with the scurvy, racked their minds
      with intolerable suspense, burned their bodies with the slow fire of
      famine, and delighted in each separate pang, until they sank beneath the
      fearful accumulation. Theseus [Sherman. D.W.]--the deliverer--was coming.
      His terrible sword could be seen gleaming as it rose and fell on the banks
      of the James, and in the mountains beyond Atlanta, where he was hewing his
      way towards them and the heart of the Southern Confederacy. But he came
      too late to save them. Strike as swiftly and as heavily as he would, he
      could not strike so hard nor so sure at his foes with saber blow and
      musket shot, as they could at the hapless youths with the dreadful
      armament of starvation and disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the deaths were one thousand eight hundred and seventeen more than
      were killed at the battle of Shiloh--this left the number in the prison at
      the end of the month thirty-one thousand six hundred and seventy-eight.
      Let me assist the reader's comprehension of the magnitude of this number
      by giving the population of a few important Cities, according to the

      It was more soldiers than could be raised to-day, under strong pressure,
      in either Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,

      These thirty-one thousand six hundred and seventy-eight active young men,
      who were likely to find the confines of a State too narrow for them, were
      cooped up on thirteen acres of ground--less than a farmer gives for
      play-ground for a half dozen colts or a small flock of sheep. There was
      hardly room for all to lie down at night, and to walk a few hundred feet
      in any direction would require an hour's patient threading of the mass of
      men and tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather became hotter and hotter; at midday the sand would burn the
      hand. The thin skins of fair and auburn-haired men blistered under the
      sun's rays, and swelled up in great watery puffs, which soon became the
      breeding grounds of the hideous maggots, or the still more deadly
      gangrene. The loathsome swamp grew in rank offensiveness with every
      burning hour. The pestilence literally stalked at noon-day, and struck his
      victims down on every hand. One could not look a rod in any direction
      without seeing at least a dozen men in the last frightful stages of
      rotting Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me describe the scene immediately around my own tent during the last
      two weeks of July, as a sample of the condition of the whole prison: I
      will take a space not larger than a good sized parlor or sitting room. On
      this were at least fifty of us. Directly in front of me lay two
      brothers--named Sherwood--belonging to Company I, of my battalion, who
      came originally from Missouri. They were now in the last stages of scurvy
      and diarrhea. Every particle of muscle and fat about their limbs and
      bodies had apparently wasted away, leaving the skin clinging close to the
      bone of the face, arms, hands, ribs and thighs--everywhere except the feet
      and legs, where it was swollen tense and transparent, distended with
      gallons of purulent matter. Their livid gums, from which most of their
      teeth had already fallen, protruded far beyond their lips. To their left
      lay a Sergeant and two others of their company, all three slowly dying
      from diarrhea, and beyond was a fair-haired German, young and intelligent
      looking, whose life was ebbing tediously away. To my right was a handsome
      young Sergeant of an Illinois Infantry Regiment, captured at Kenesaw. His
      left arm had been amputated between the shoulder and elbow, and he was
      turned into the Stockade with the stump all undressed, save the ligating
      of the arteries. Of course, he had not been inside an hour until the
      maggot flies had laid eggs in the open wound, and before the day was gone
      the worms were hatched out, and rioting amid the inflamed and
      super-sensitive nerves, where their every motion was agony. Accustomed as
      we were to misery, we found a still lower depth in his misfortune, and I
      would be happier could I forget his pale, drawn face, as he wandered
      uncomplainingly to and fro, holding his maimed limb with his right hand,
      occasionally stopping to squeeze it, as one does a boil, and press from it
      a stream of maggots and pus. I do not think he ate or slept for a week
      before he died. Next to him staid an Irish Sergeant of a New York
      Regiment, a fine soldierly man, who, with pardonable pride, wore,
      conspicuously on his left breast, a medal gained by gallantry while a
      British soldier in the Crimea. He was wasting away with diarrhea, and died
      before the month was out. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp261"

      This was what one could see on every square rod of the prison. Where I was
      was not only no worse than the rest of the prison, but was probably much
      better and healthier, as it was the highest ground inside, farthest from
      the Swamp, and having the dead line on two sides, had a ventilation that
      those nearer the center could not possibly have. Yet, with all these
      conditions in our favor, the mortality was as I have described.

      Near us an exasperating idiot, who played the flute, had established
      himself. Like all poor players, he affected the low, mournful notes, as
      plaintive as the distant cooing of the dove in lowering, weather. He
      played or rather tooted away in his "blues"-inducing strain hour after
      hour, despite our energetic protests, and occasionally flinging a club at
      him. There was no more stop to him than to a man with a hand-organ, and to
      this day the low, sad notes of a flute are the swiftest reminder to me of
      those sorrowful, death-laden days. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp262"

      I had an illustration one morning of how far decomposition would progress
      in a man's body before he died. My chum and I found a treasure-trove in
      the streets, in the shape of the body of a man who died during the night.
      The value of this "find" was that if we took it to the gate, we would be
      allowed to carry it outside to the deadhouse, and on our way back have an
      opportunity to pick up a chunk of wood, to use in cooking. While
      discussing our good luck another party came up and claimed the body. A
      verbal dispute led to one of blows, in which we came off victorious, and I
      hastily caught hold of the arm near the elbow to help bear the body away.
      The skin gave way under my hand, and slipped with it down to the wrist,
      like a torn sleeve. It was sickening, but I clung to my prize, and secured
      a very good chunk of wood while outside with it. The wood was very much
      needed by my mess, as our squad had then had none for more than a week.

      THE BATTLE OF THE 22D OF JULY--THE ARMS OF THE TENNESSEE ASSAULTED FRONT
      AND REAR--DEATH OF GENERAL MCPHERSON--ASSUMPTION OF COMMAND BY GENERAL
      LOGAN--RESULT OF THE BATTLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, we had a consuming hunger for news of what was being
      accomplished by our armies toward crushing the Rebellion. Now, more than
      ever, had we reason to ardently wish for the destruction of the Rebel
      power. Before capture we had love of country and a natural desire for the
      triumph of her flag to animate us. Now we had a hatred of the Rebels that
      passed expression, and a fierce longing to see those who daily tortured
      and insulted us trampled down in the dust of humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daily arrival of prisoners kept us tolerably well informed as to the
      general progress of the campaign, and we added to the information thus
      obtained by getting--almost daily--in some manner or another--a copy of a
      Rebel paper. Most frequently these were Atlanta papers, or an issue of the
      "Memphis-Corinth-Jackson-Grenada-Chattanooga-Resacca-Marietta-Atlanta
      Appeal," as they used to facetiously term a Memphis paper that left that
      City when it was taken in 1862, and for two years fell back from place to
      place, as Sherman's Army advanced, until at last it gave up the struggle
      in September, 1864, in a little Town south of Atlanta, after about two
      thousand miles of weary retreat from an indefatigable pursuer. The papers
      were brought in by "fresh fish," purchased from the guards at from fifty
      cents to one dollar apiece, or occasionally thrown in to us when they had
      some specially disagreeable intelligence, like the defeat of Banks, or
      Sturgis, or Bunter, to exult over. I was particularly fortunate in getting
      hold of these. Becoming installed as general reader for a neighborhood of
      several thousand men, everything of this kind was immediately brought to
      me, to be read aloud for the benefit of everybody. All the older prisoners
      knew me by the nick-name of "Illinoy" --a designation arising from my
      wearing on my cap, when I entered prison, a neat little white metal badge
      of "ILLS." When any reading matter was brought into our neighborhood,
      there would be a general cry of:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it up to 'Illinoy,'" and then hundreds would mass around my quarters
      to bear the news read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebel papers usually had very meager reports of the operations of the
      armies, and these were greatly distorted, but they were still very
      interesting, and as we always started in to read with the expectation that
      the whole statement was a mass of perversions and lies, where truth was an
      infrequent accident, we were not likely to be much impressed with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a marled difference in the tone of the reports brought in from
      the different armies. Sherman's men were always sanguine. They had no
      doubt that they were pushing the enemy straight to the wall, and that
      every day brought the Southern Confederacy much nearer its downfall. Those
      from the Army of the Potomac were never so hopeful. They would admit that
      Grant was pounding Lee terribly, but the shadow of the frequent defeats of
      the Army of the Potomac seemed to hang depressingly over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day, however, when our sanguine hopes as to Sherman were
      checked by a possibility that he had failed; that his long campaign
      towards Atlanta had culminated in such a reverse under the very walls of
      the City as would compel an abandonment of the enterprise, and possibly a
      humiliating retreat. We knew that Jeff. Davis and his Government were
      strongly dissatisfied with the Fabian policy of Joe Johnston. The papers
      had told us of the Rebel President's visit to Atlanta, of his bitter
      comments on Johnston's tactics; of his going so far as to sneer about the
      necessity of providing pontoons at Key West, so that Johnston might
      continue his retreat even to Cuba. Then came the news of Johnston's
      Supersession by Hood, and the papers were full of the exulting predictions
      of what would now be accomplished "when that gallant young soldier is once
      fairly in the saddle."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this meant one supreme effort to arrest the onward course of Sherman.
      It indicated a resolve to stake the fate of Atlanta, and the fortunes of
      the Confederacy in the West, upon the hazard of one desperate fight. We
      watched the summoning up of every Rebel energy for the blow with
      apprehension. We dreaded another Chickamauga.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow fell on the 22d of July. It was well planned. The Army of the
      Tennessee, the left of Sherman's forces, was the part struck. On the night
      of the 21st Hood marched a heavy force around its left flank and gained
      its rear. On the 22d this force fell on the rear with the impetuous
      violence of a cyclone, while the Rebels in the works immediately around
      Atlanta attacked furiously in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ordeal that no other army ever passed through successfully. The
      steadiest troops in Europe would think it foolhardiness to attempt to
      withstand an assault in force in front and rear at the same time. The
      finest legions that follow any flag to-day must almost inevitably succumb
      to such a mode of attack. But the seasoned veterans of the Army of the
      Tennessee encountered the shock with an obstinacy which showed that the
      finest material for soldiery this planet holds was that in which undaunted
      hearts beat beneath blue blouses. Springing over the front of their
      breastworks, they drove back with a withering fire the force assailing
      them in the rear. This beaten off, they jumped back to their proper
      places, and repulsed the assault in front. This was the way the battle was
      waged until night compelled a cessation of operations. Our boys were
      alternately behind the breastworks firing at Rebels advancing upon the
      front, and in front of the works firing upon those coming up in the rear.
      Sometimes part of our line would be on one side of the works, and part on
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the prison we were greatly excited over the result of the engagement,
      of which we were uncertain for many days. A host of new prisoners perhaps
      two thousand--was brought in from there, but as they were captured during
      the progress of the fight, they could not speak definitely as to its
      issue. The Rebel papers exulted without stint over what they termed "a
      glorious victory." They were particularly jubilant over the death of
      McPherson, who, they claimed, was the brain and guiding hand of Sherman's
      army. One paper likened him to the pilot-fish, which guides the shark to
      his prey. Now that he was gone, said the paper, Sherman's army becomes a
      great lumbering hulk, with no one in it capable of directing it, and it
      must soon fall to utter ruin under the skilfully delivered strokes of the
      gallant Hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also knew that great numbers of wounded had been brought to the prison
      hospital, and this seemed to confirm the Rebel claim of a victory, as it
      showed they retained possession of the battle field. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a name="linkp268" id="linkp268"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 1st of August a large squad of Sherman's men, captured in one of
      the engagements subsequent to the 22d, came in. We gathered around them
      eagerly. Among them I noticed a bright, curly-haired, blue-eyed
      infantryman--or boy, rather, as he was yet beardless. His cap was marked
      "68th O. Y. Y. L," his sleeves were garnished with re-enlistment stripes,
      and on the breast of his blouse was a silver arrow. To the eye of the
      soldier this said that he was a veteran member of the Sixty-Eighth
      Regiment of Ohio Infantry (that is, having already served three years, he
      had re-enlisted for the war), and that he belonged to the Third Division
      of the Seventeenth Army Corps. He was so young and fresh looking that one
      could hardly believe him to be a veteran, but if his stripes had not said
      this, the soldierly arrangement of clothing and accouterments, and the
      graceful, self-possessed pose of limbs and body would have told the
      observer that he was one of those "Old Reliables" with whom Sherman and
      Grant had already subdued a third of the Confederacy. His blanket, which,
      for a wonder, the Rebels had neglected to take from him, was tightly
      rolled, its ends tied together, and thrown over his shoulder
      scarf-fashion. His pantaloons were tucked inside his stocking tops, that
      were pulled up as far as possible, and tied tightly around his ankle with
      a string. A none-too-clean haversack, containing the inevitable sooty
      quart cup, and even blacker half-canteen, waft slung easily from the
      shoulder opposite to that on which the blanket rested. Hand him his
      faithful Springfield rifle, put three days' rations in his haversack, and
      forty rounds in his cartridge bog, and he would be ready, without an
      instant's demur or question, to march to the ends of the earth, and fight
      anything that crossed his path. He was a type of the honest, honorable,
      self respecting American boy, who, as a soldier, the world has not equaled
      in the sixty centuries that war has been a profession. I suggested to him
      that he was rather a youngster to be wearing veteran chevrons. "Yes," said
      he, "I am not so old as some of the rest of the boys, but I have seen
      about as much service and been in the business about as long as any of
      them. They call me 'Old Dad,' I suppose because I was the youngest boy in
      the Regiment, when we first entered the service, though our whole Company,
      officers and all, were only a lot of boys, and the Regiment to day, what's
      left of 'em, are about as young a lot of officers and men as there are in
      the service. Why, our old Colonel ain't only twenty-four years old now,
      and he has been in command ever since we went into Vicksburg. I have heard
      it said by our boys that since we veteranized the whole Regiment,
      officers, and men, average less than twenty-four years old. But they are
      gray-hounds to march and stayers in a fight, you bet. Why, the rest of the
      troops over in West Tennessee used to call our Brigade 'Leggett's
      Cavalry,' for they always had us chasing Old Forrest, and we kept him
      skedaddling, too, pretty lively. But I tell you we did get into a red hot
      scrimmage on the 22d. It just laid over Champion Hills, or any of the big
      fights around Vicksburg, and they were lively enough to amuse any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you were in the affair on the 22d, were you! We are awful anxious to
      hear all about it. Come over here to my quarters and tell us all you know.
      All we know is that there has been a big fight, with McPherson killed, and
      a heavy loss of life besides, and the Rebels claim a great victory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, they be -----. It was the sickest victory they ever got. About one
      more victory of that kind would make their infernal old Confederacy ready
      for a coroner's inquest. Well, I can tell you pretty much all about that
      fight, for I reckon if the truth was known, our regiment fired about the
      first and last shot that opened and closed the fighting on that day. Well,
      you see the whole Army got across the river, and were closing in around
      the City of Atlanta. Our Corps, the Seventeenth, was the extreme left of
      the army, and were moving up toward the City from the East. The Fifteenth
      (Logan's) Corps joined us on the right, then the Army of the Cumberland
      further to the right. We run onto the Rebs about sundown the 21st. They
      had some breastworks on a ridge in front of us, and we had a pretty sharp
      fight before we drove them off. We went right to work, and kept at it all
      night in changing and strengthening the old Rebel barricades, fronting
      them towards Atlanta, and by morning had some good solid works along our
      whole line. During the night we fancied we could hear wagons or artillery
      moving away in front of us, apparently going South, or towards our left.
      About three or four o'clock in the morning, while I was shoveling dirt
      like a beaver out on the works, the Lieutenant came to me and said the
      Colonel wanted to see me, pointing to a large tree in the rear, where I
      could find him. I reported and found him with General Leggett, who
      commanded our Division, talking mighty serious, and Bob Wheeler, of F
      Company, standing there with his Springfield at a parade rest. As soon as
      I came up, the Colonel says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys, the General wants two level-headed chaps to go out beyond the
      pickets to the front and toward the left. I have selected you for the
      duty. Go as quietly as possible and as fast as you can; keep your eyes and
      ears open; don't fire a shot if you can help it, and come back and tell us
      exactly what you have seen and heard, and not what you imagine or suspect.
      I have selected you for the duty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gave us the countersign, and off we started over the breastworks and
      through the thick woods. We soon came to our skirmish or pickets, only a
      few rods in front of our works, and cautioned them not to fire on us in
      going or returning. We went out as much as half a mile or more, until we
      could plainly hear the sound of wagons and artillery. We then cautiously
      crept forward until we could see the main road leading south from the City
      filled with marching men, artillery and teams. We could hear the commands
      of the officers and see the flags and banners of regiment after regiment
      as they passed us. We got back quietly and quickly, passed through our
      picket line all right, and found the General and our Colonel sitting on a
      log where we had left them, waiting for us. We reported what we had seen
      and heard, and gave it as our opinion that the Johnnies were evacuating
      Atlanta. The General shook his head, and the Colonel says: 'You may re
      turn to your company.' Bob says to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The old General shakes his head as though he thought them d---d Rebs
      ain't evacuating Atlanta so mighty sudden, but are up to some devilment
      again. I ain't sure but he's right. They ain't going to keep falling back
      and falling back to all eternity, but are just agoin' to give us a
      rip-roaring great big fight one o' these days--when they get a good ready.
      You hear me!' <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp270" id="linkp270"></a>

      "Saying which we both went to our companies, and laid down to get a little
      sleep. It was about daylight then, and I must have snoozed away until near
      noon, when I heard the order 'fall in!' and found the regiment getting
      into line, and the boys all tallying about going right into Atlanta; that
      the Rebels had evacuated the City during the night, and that we were going
      to have a race with the Fifteenth Corps as to which would get into the
      City first. We could look away out across a large field in front of our
      works, and see the skirmish line advancing steadily towards the main works
      around the City. Not a shot was being, fired on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To our surprise, instead of marching to the front and toward the City, we
      filed off into a small road cut through the woods and marched rapidly to
      the rear. We could not understand what it meant. We marched at quick time,
      feeling pretty mad that we had to go to the rear, when the rest of our
      Division were going into Atlanta.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We passed the Sixteenth Corps lying on their arms, back in some open
      fields, and the wagon trains of our Corps all comfortably corralled, and
      finally found ourselves out by the Seventeenth Corps headquarters. Two or
      three companies were sent out to picket several roads that seemed to cross
      at that point, as it was reported 'Rebel Cavalry' had been seen on these
      roads but a short time before, and this accounted for our being rushed out
      in such a great hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had just stacked arms and were going to take a little rest after our
      rapid march, when several Rebel prisoners were brought in by some of the
      boys who had straggled a little. They found the Rebels on the road we had
      just marched out on. Up to this time not a shot had been fired. All was
      quiet back at the main works we had just left, when suddenly we saw
      several staff officers come tearing up to the Colonel, who ordered us to
      'fall in!' 'Take aims!' 'about, face!' The Lieutenant Colonel dashed down
      one of the roads where one of the companies had gone out on picket. The
      Major and Adjutant galloped down the others. We did not wait for them to
      come back, though, but moved right back on the road we had just come out,
      in line of battle, our colors in the road, and our flanks in open timber.
      We soon reached a fence enclosing a large field, and there could see a
      line of Rebels moving by the flank, and forming, facing toward Atlanta,
      but to the left and in the rear of the position occupied by our Corps. As
      soon as we reached the fence we fired a round or two into the backs of
      these gray coats, who broke into confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just then the other companies joined us, and we moved off on 'double
      quick by the right flank,' for you see we were completely cut off from the
      troops up at the front, and we had to get well over to the right to get
      around the flank of the Rebels. Just about the time we fired on the rebels
      the Sixteenth Corps opened up a hot fire of musketry and artillery on
      them, some of their shot coming over mighty close to where we were. We
      marched pretty fast, and finally turned in through some open fields to the
      left, and came out just in the rear of the Sixteenth Corps, who were
      fighting like devils along their whole line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as we came out into the open field we saw General R. K. Scott, who
      used to be our Colonel, and who commanded our brigade, come tearing toward
      us with one or two aids or orderlies. He was on his big clay-bank horse,
      'Old Hatchie,' as we called him, as we captured him on the battlefield at
      the battle of 'Matamora,' or 'Hell on the Hatchie,' as our boys always
      called it. He rode up to the Colonel, said something hastily, when all at
      once we heard the all-firedest crash of musketry and artillery way up at
      the front where we had built the works the night before and left the rest
      of our brigade and Division getting ready to prance into Atlanta when we
      were sent off to the rear. Scott put spurs to his old horse, who was one
      of the fastest runners in our Division, and away he went back towards the
      position where his brigade and the troops immediately to their left were
      now hotly engaged. He rode right along in rear of the Sixteenth Corps,
      paying no attention apparently to the shot and shell and bullets that were
      tearing up the earth and exploding and striking all around him. His aids
      and orderlies vainly tried to keep up with him. We could plainly see the
      Rebel lines as they came out of the woods into the open grounds to attack
      the Sixteenth Corps, which had hastily formed in the open field, without
      any signs of works, and were standing up like men, having a hand-to-hand
      fight. We were just far enough in the rear so that every blasted shot or
      shell that was fired too high to hit the ranks of the Sixteenth Corps came
      rattling over amongst us. All this time we were marching fast, following
      in the direction General Scott had taken, who evidently had ordered the
      Colonel to join his brigade up at the front. We were down under the crest
      of a little hill, following along the bank of a little creek, keeping
      under cover of the bank as much as possible to protect us from the shots
      of the enemy. We suddenly saw General Logan and one or two of his staff
      upon the right bank of the ravine riding rapidly toward us. As he neared
      the head of the regiment he shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Halt! What regiment is that, and where are you going?'" The Colonel, in
      a loud voice, that all could hear, told him: "The Sixty-Eighth Ohio; going
      to join our brigade of the Third Division--your old Division, General, of
      the Seventeenth Corps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Logan says, 'you had better go right in here on the left of Dodge. The
      Third Division have hardly ground enough left now to bury their dead. God
      knows they need you. But try it on, if you think you can get to them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just at this moment a staff officer came riding up on the opposite side
      of the ravine from where Logan was and interrupted Logan, who was about
      telling the Colonel not to try to go to the position held by the Third
      Division by the road cut through the woods whence we had come out, but to
      keep off to the right towards the Fifteenth Corps, as the woods referred
      to were full of Rebels. The officer saluted Logan, and shouted across:
    </p>
    <p>
      "General Sherman directs me to inform you of the death of General
      McPherson, and orders you to take command of the Army of the Tennessee;
      have Dodge close well up to the Seventeenth Corps, and Sherman will
      reinforce you to the extent of the whole army.' <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Logan, standing in his stirrups, on his beautiful black horse, formed a
      picture against the blue sky as we looked up the ravine at him, his black
      eyes fairly blazing and his long black hair waving in the wind. He replied
      in a ringing, clear tone that we all could hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say to General Sherman I have heard of McPherson's death, and have
      assumed the command of the Army of the Tennessee, and have already
      anticipated his orders in regard to closing the gap between Dodge and the
      Seventeenth Corps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, of course, all happened in one quarter of the time I have been
      telling you. Logan put spurs to his horse and rode in one direction, the
      staff officer of General Sherman in another, and we started on a rapid
      step toward the front. This was the first we had heard of McPherson's
      death, and it made us feel very bad. Some of the officers and men cried as
      though they had lost a brother; others pressed their lips, gritted their
      teeth, and swore to avenge his death. He was a great favorite with all his
      Army, particularly of our Corps, which he commanded for a long while. Our
      company, especially, knew him well, and loved him dearly, for we had been
      his Headquarters Guard for over a year. As we marched along, toward the
      front, we could see brigades, and regiments, and batteries of artillery;
      coming over from the right of the Army, and taking position in new lines
      in rear of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps. Major Generals and their
      staffs, Brigadier Generals and their staffs, were mighty thick along the
      banks of the little ravine we were following; stragglers and wounded men
      by the hundred were pouring in to the safe shelter formed by the broken
      ground along which we were rapidly marching; stories were heard of
      divisions, brigades and regiments that these wounded or stragglers
      belonged, having been all cut to pieces; officers all killed; and the
      speaker, the only one of his command not killed, wounded or captured. But
      you boys have heard and seen the same cowardly sneaks, probably, in fights
      that you were in. The battle raged furiously all this time; part of the
      time the Sixteenth Corps seemed to be in the worst; then it would let up
      on them and the Seventeenth Corps would be hotly engaged along their whole
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had probably marched half an hour since leaving Logan, and were
      getting pretty near back to our main line of works, when the Colonel
      ordered a halt and knapsacks to be unslung and piled up. I tell you it was
      a relief to get them off, for it was a fearful hot day, and we had been
      marching almost double quick. We knew that this meant business though, and
      that we were stripping for the fight, which we would soon be in. Just at
      this moment we saw an ambulance, with the horses on a dead run, followed
      by two or three mounted officers and men, coming right towards us out of
      the very woods Logan had cautioned the Colonel to avoid. When the
      ambulance got to where we were it halted. It was pretty well out of danger
      from the bullets and shell of the enemy. They stopped, and we recognized
      Major Strong, of McPherson's Staff, whom the all knew, as he was the Chief
      Inspector of our Corps, and in the ambulance he had the body of General
      McPherson. Major Strong, it appears, during a slight lull in the fighting
      at that part of the line, having taken an ambulance and driven into the
      very jaws of death to recover the remains of his loved commander. It seems
      he found the body right by the side of the little road that we had gone
      out on when we went to the rear. He was dead when he found him, having
      been shot off his horse, the bullet striking him in the back, just below
      his heart, probably killing him instantly. There was a young fellow with
      him who was wounded also, when Strong found them. He belonged to our First
      Division, and recognized General McPherson, and stood by him until Major
      Strong came up. He was in the ambulance with the body of McPherson when
      they stopped by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems that when the fight opened away back in the rear where we had
      been, and at the left of the Sixteenth Corps which was almost directly in
      the rear of the Seventeenth Corps, McPherson sent his staff and orderlies
      with various orders to different parts of the line, and started himself to
      ride over from the Seventeenth Corps to the Sixteenth Corps, taking
      exactly the same course our Regiment had, perhaps an hour before, but the
      Rebels had discovered there was a gap between the Sixteenth and
      Seventeenth Corps, and meeting no opposition to their advances in this
      strip of woods, where they were hidden from view, they had marched right
      along down in the rear, and with their line at right angles with the line
      of works occupied by the left of the Seventeenth Corps; they were thus
      parallel and close to the little road McPherson had taken, and probably he
      rode right into them and was killed before he realized the true situation.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having piled our knapsacks, and left a couple of our older men, who were
      played out with the heat and most ready to drop with sunstroke, to guard
      them, we started on again. The ambulance with the corpse of Gen. McPherson
      moved off towards the right of the Army, which was the last we ever saw of
      that brave and handsome soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We bore off a little to the right of a large open field on top of a high
      hill where one of our batteries was pounding away at a tremendous rate. We
      came up to the main line of works just about at the left of the Fifteenth
      Corps. They seemed to be having an easy time of it just then --no fighting
      going on in their front, except occasional shots from some heavy guns on
      the main line of Rebel works around the City. We crossed right over the
      Fifteenth Corps' works and filed to the left, keeping along on the outside
      of our works. We had not gone far before the Rebel gunners in the main
      works around the City discovered us; and the way they did tear loose at us
      was a caution. Their aim was rather bad, however, and most of their shots
      went over us. We saw one of them--I think it was a shell--strike an
      artillery caisson belonging to one of our-batteries. It exploded as it
      struck, and then the caisson, which was full of ammunition, exploded with
      an awful noise, throwing pieces of wood and iron and its own load of shot
      and shell high into the air, scattering death and destruction to the men
      and horses attached to it. We thought we saw arms and legs and parts of
      bodies of men flying in every direction; but we were glad to learn
      afterwards that it was the contents of the knapsacks of the Battery boys,
      who had strapped them on the caissons for transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just after passing the hill where our battery was making things so
      lively, they stopped firing to let us pass. We saw General Leggett, our
      Division Commander, come riding toward us. He was outside of our line of
      works, too. You know how we build breastworks--sort of zigzag like, you
      know, so they cannot be enfiladed. Well, that's just the way the works
      were along there, and you never saw such a curious shape as we formed our
      Division in. Why, part of them were on one side of the works, and go along
      a little further and here was a regiment, or part of a regiment on the
      other side, both sets firing in opposite directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sir'ee, they were not demoralized or in confusion, they were cool and
      as steady as on parade. But the old Division had, you know, never been
      driven from any position they had once taken, in all their long service,
      and they did not propose to leave that ridge until they got orders from
      some one beside the Rebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were times when a fellow did not know which side of the works was
      the safest, for the Johnnies were in front of us and in rear of us. You
      see, our Fourth Division, which had been to the left of us, had been
      forced to quit their works, when the Rebs got into the works in their
      rear, so that our Division was now at the point where our line turned
      sharply to the left, and rear--in the direction of the Sixteenth Corps.

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "We got into business before we had been there over three minutes. A line
      of the Rebs tried to charge across the open fields in front of us, but by
      the help of the old twenty-four pounders (which proved to be part of
      Cooper's Illinois Battery, that we had been alongside of in many a hard
      fight before), we drove them back a-flying, only to have to jump over on
      the outside of our works the next minute to tackle a heavy force that came
      for our rear through that blasted strip of woods. We soon drove them off,
      and the firing on both sides seemed to have pretty much stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Our Brigade,' which we discovered, was now commanded by 'Old Whiskers'
      (Colonel Piles, of the Seventy-Eighth Ohio. I'll bet he's got the longest
      whiskers of any man in the Army.) You see General Scott had not been seen
      or heard of since he had started to the rear after our regiment when the
      fighting first commenced. We all believed that he was either killed or
      captured, or he would have been with his command. He was a splendid
      soldier, and a bull-dog of a fighter. His absence was a great loss, but we
      had not much time to think of such things, for our brigade was then
      ordered to leave the works and to move to the right about twenty or thirty
      rods across a large ravine, where we were placed in position in an open
      corn-field, forming a new line at quite an angle from the line of works we
      had just left, extending to the left, and getting us back nearer onto a
      line with the Sixteenth Corps. The battery of howitzers, now reinforced by
      a part of the Third Ohio heavy guns, still occupied the old works on the
      highest part of the hill, just to the right of our new line. We took our
      position just on the brow of a hill, and were ordered to lie down, and the
      rear rank to go for rails, which we discovered a few rods behind us in the
      shape of a good ten-rail fence. Every rear-rank chap came back with all
      the rails he could lug, and we barely had time to lay them down in front
      of us, forming a little barricade of six to eight or ten inches high, when
      we heard the most unearthly Rebel yell directly in front of us. It grew
      louder and came nearer and nearer, until we could see a solid line of the
      gray coats coming out of the woods and down the opposite slope, their
      battle flags flying, officers in front with drawn swords, arms at right
      shoulder, and every one of them yelling like so many Sioux Indians. The
      line seemed to be massed six or eight ranks deep, followed closely by the
      second line, and that by the third, each, if possible, yelling louder and
      appearing more desperately reckless than the one ahead. At their first
      appearance we opened on them, and so did the bully old
      twenty-four-pounders, with canister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On they came; the first line staggered and wavered back on to the second,
      which was coming on the double quick. Such a raking as we did give them.
      Oh, Lordy, how we did wish that we had the breech loading Spencers or
      Winchesters. But we had the old reliable Springfields, and we poured it in
      hot and heavy. By the time the charging column got down the opposite
      slope, and were struggling through the thicket of undergrowth in the
      ravine, they were one confused mass of officers and men, the three lines
      now forming one solid column, which made several desperate efforts to rush
      up to the top of the hill where we were punishing them so. One of their
      first surges came mighty near going right over the left of our Regiment,
      as they were lying down behind their little rail piles. But the boys
      clubbed their guns and the officers used their revolvers and swords and
      drove them back down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Seventy-Eighth and Twentieth Ohio, our right and left bowers, who had
      been brigaded with us ever since 'Shiloh,' were into it as hot and heavy
      as we had been, and had lost numbers of their officers and men, but were
      hanging on to their little rail piles when the fight was over. At one time
      the Rebs were right in on top of the Seventy-Eighth. One big Reb grabbed
      their colors, and tried to pull them out of the hands of the color-bearer.
      But old Captain Orr, a little, short, dried-up fellow, about sixty years
      old, struck him with his sword across the back of the neck, and killed him
      deader than a mackerel, right in his tracks. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      "It was now getting dark, and the Johnnies concluded they had taken a
      bigger contract in trying to drive us off that hill in one day than they
      had counted on, so they quit charging on us, but drew back under cover of
      the woods and along the old line of works that we had left, and kept up a
      pecking away and sharp-shooting at us all night long. They opened fire on
      us from a number of pieces of artillery from the front, from the left, and
      from some heavy guns away over to the right of us, in the main works
      around Atlanta.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did not fool away much time that night, either. We got our shovels and
      picks, and while part of us were sharpshooting and trying to keep the
      Rebels from working up too close to us, the rest of the boys were putting
      up some good solid earthworks right where our rail piles had been, and by
      morning we were in splendid shape to have received our friends, no matter
      which way they had come at us, for they kept up such an all-fired shelling
      of us from so many different directions; that the boys had built traverses
      and bomb-proofs at all sorts of angles and in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was one point off to our right, a few rods up along our old line of
      works where there was a crowd of Rebel sharpshooters that annoyed us more
      than all the rest, by their constant firing at us through the night. They
      killed one of Company H's boys, and wounded several others. Finally
      Captain Williams, of D Company, came along and said he wanted a couple of
      good shots out of our company to go with him, so I went for one. He took
      about ten of us, and we crawled down into the ravine in front of where we
      were building the works, and got behind a large fallen tree, and we laid
      there and could just fire right up into the rear of those fellows as they
      lay behind a traverse extending back from our old line of works. It was so
      dark we could only see where to fire by the flash of guns, but every time
      they would shoot, some of us would let them have one. They staid there
      until almost daylight, when they, concluded as things looked, since we
      were going to stay, they had better be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an awful night. Down in the ravine below us lay hundreds of killed
      and wounded Rebels, groaning and crying aloud for water and for help. We
      did do what we could for those right around us--but it was so dark, and so
      many shell bursting and bullets flying around that a fellow could not get
      about much. I tell you it was pretty tough next morning to go along to the
      different companies of our regiment and hear who were among the killed and
      wounded, and to see the long row of graves that were being dug to bury our
      comrades and our officers. There was the Captain of Company E, Nelson
      Skeeles, of Fulton County, O., one of--the bravest and best officers in
      the regiment. By his side lay First Sergeant Lesnit, and next were the two
      great, powerful Shepherds--cousins but more like brothers. One, it seems,
      was killed while supporting the head of the other, who had just received a
      death wound, thus dying in each other's arms. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't begin to think or tell you the names of all the poor boys
      that we laid away to rest in their last, long sleep on that gloomy day.
      Our Major was severely wounded, and several other officers had been hit
      more or less badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a frightful sight, though, to go over the field in front of our
      works on that morning. The Rebel dead and badly wounded laid where they
      had fallen. The bottom and opposite side of the ravine showed how
      destructive our fire and that of the canister from the howitzers had been.
      The underbrush was cut, slashed, and torn into shreds, and the larger
      trees were scarred, bruised and broken by the thousands of bullets and
      other missiles that had been poured into them from almost every
      conceivable direction during the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lot of us boys went way over to the left into Fuller's Division of the
      Sixteenth Corps, to see how some of our boys over there had got through
      the scrimmage, for they had about as nasty a fight as any part of the
      Army, and if it had not been for their being just where they were, I am
      not sure but what the old Seventeenth Corps would have had a different
      story to tell now. We found our friends had been way out by Decatur, where
      their brigade had got into a pretty lively fight on their own hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We got back to camp, and the first thing I knew I was detailed for picket
      duty, and we were posted over a few rods across the ravine in our front.
      We had not been out but a short time when we saw a flag of truce, borne by
      an officer, coming towards us. We halted him, and made him wait until a
      report was sent back to Corps headquarters. The Rebel officer was quite
      chatty and talkative with our picket officer, while waiting. He said he
      was on General Cleburne's staff, and that the troops that charged us so
      fiercely the evening before was Cleburne's whole Division, and that after
      their last repulse, knowing the hill where we were posted was the most
      important position along our line, he felt that if they would keep close
      to us during the night, and keep up a show of fight, that we would pull
      out and abandon the hill before morning. He said that he, with about fifty
      of their best men, had volunteered to keep up the demonstration, and it
      was his party that had occupied the traverse in our old works the night
      before and had annoyed us and the Battery men by their constant
      sharpshooting, which we fellows behind the old tree had finally tired out.
      He said they staid until almost daylight, and that he lost more than half
      his men before he left. He also told us that General Scott was captured by
      their Division, at about the time and almost the same spot as where
      General McPherson was killed, and that he was not hurt or wounded, and was
      now a prisoner in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a lot of our staff officers soon came out, and as near as we could
      learn the Rebels wanted a truce to bury their dead. Our folks tried to get
      up an exchange of prisoners that had been taken by both sides the day
      before, but for some reason they could not bring it about. But the truce
      for burying the dead was agreed to. Along about dusk some of the boys on
      my post got to telling about a lot of silver and brass instruments that
      belonged to one of the bands of the Fourth Division, which had been hung
      up in some small trees a little way over in front of where we were when
      the fight was going on the day before, and that when, a bullet would
      strike one of the horns they could hear it go 'pin-g' and in a few minutes
      'pan-g' would go another bullet through one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A new picket was just coming' on, and I had picked up my blanket and
      haversack, and was about ready to start back to camp, when, thinks I,
      'I'll just go out there and see about them horns.' I told the boys what I
      was going to do. They all seemed to think it was safe enough, so out I
      started. I had not gone more than a hundred yards, I should think, when
      here I found the horns all hanging around on the trees just as the boys
      had described. Some of them had lots of bullet holes in them. But I saw a
      beautiful, nice looking silver bugle hanging off to one side a little. 'I
      Thinks,' says I, 'I'll just take that little toot horn in out of the wet,
      and take it back to camp.' I was just reaching up after it when I heard
      some one say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Halt!' and I'll be dog-Boned if there wasn't two of the meanest looking
      Rebels, standing not ten feet from me, with their guns cocked and pointed
      at me, and, of course, I knew I was a goner; they walked me back about one
      hundred and fifty yards, where their picket line was. From there I was
      kept going for an hour or two until we got over to a place on the railroad
      called East Point. There I got in with a big crowd of our prisoners, who
      were taken the day before, and we have been fooling along in a lot of old
      cattle cars getting down here ever since.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

Note: This eBook is an updated edition of a pre #10000 PG file which
is being inserted into the modern PG filename directory system; though
it has an eBook number below #10000 it is filed as the eBooks with numbers
over #10000.  See the link at the beginning of this trailer.
